\
\
1.  introduction\
\
   zstandard, or "zstd" (pronounced "zee standard"), is a data\
   compression mechanism, akin to gzip [rfc1952].\
\
   despite use of the word "standard" as part of its name, readers are\
   advised that this document is not an internet standards track\
   specification; it is being published for informational purposes only.\
\
   this document describes the zstandard format.  also, to enable the\
   transport of a data object compressed with zstandard, this document\
   registers a media type that can be used to identify such content when\
   it is used in a payload encoded using multipurpose internet mail\
   extensions (mime).\
\
2.  definitions\
\
   some terms used elsewhere in this document are defined here for\
   clarity.\
\
   uncompressed:  describes an arbitrary set of bytes in their original\
      form, prior to being subjected to compression.\
\
   compress, compression:  the act of processing a set of bytes via the\
      compression mechanism described here.\
\
   compressed:  describes the result of passing a set of bytes through\
      this mechanism.  the original input has thus been compressed.\
\
   decompress, decompression:  the act of processing a set of bytes\
      through the inverse of the compression mechanism described here,\
      in an attempt to recover the original set of bytes prior to\
      compression.\
\
   decompressed:  describes the result of passing a set of bytes through\
      the reverse of this mechanism.  when this is successful, the\
      decompressed payload and the uncompressed payload are\
      indistinguishable.\
\
   encode:  the process of translating data from one form to another;\
      this may include compression or it may refer to other translations\
      done as part of this specification.\
\
   decode:  the reverse of "encode"; describes a process of reversing a\
      prior encoding to recover the original content.\

\
\
   frame:  content compressed by zstandard is transformed into a\
      zstandard frame.  multiple frames can be appended into a single\
      file or stream.  a frame is completely independent, has a defined\
      beginning and end, and has a set of parameters that tells the\
      decoder how to decompress it.\
\
   block:  a frame encapsulates one or multiple blocks.  each block\
      contains arbitrary content, which is described by its header, and\
      has a guaranteed maximum content size that depends upon frame\
      parameters.  unlike frames, each block depends on previous blocks\
      for proper decoding.  however, each block can be decompressed\
      without waiting for its successor, allowing streaming operations.\
\
   natural order:  a sequence or ordering of objects or values that is\
      typical of that type of object or value.  a set of unique\
      integers, for example, is in "natural order" if when progressing\
      from one element in the set or sequence to the next, there is\
      never a decrease in value.\
\
   the naming convention for identifiers within the specification is\
   mixed_case_with_underscores.  identifiers inside square brackets\
   indicate that the identifier is optional in the presented context.\
\
3.  compression algorithm\
\
   this section describes the zstandard algorithm.\
\
   the purpose of this document is to define a lossless compressed data\
   format that is a) independent of the cpu type, operating system, file\
   system, and character set and b) is suitable for file compression and\
   pipe and streaming compression, using the zstandard algorithm.  the\
   text of the specification assumes a basic background in programming\
   at the level of bits and other primitive data representations.\
\
   the data can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long\
   sequentially presented input data stream, using only an a priori\
   bounded amount of intermediate storage, and hence can be used in data\
   communications.  the format uses the zstandard compression method,\
   and an optional xxhash-64 checksum method [xxhash], for detection of\
   data corruption.\
\
   the data format defined by this specification does not attempt to\
   allow random access to compressed data.\
\
   unless otherwise indicated below, a compliant compressor must produce\
   data sets that conform to the specifications presented here.\
   however, it does not need to support all options.\

\
\
   a compliant decompressor must be able to decompress at least one\
   working set of parameters that conforms to the specifications\
   presented here.  it may also ignore informative fields, such as the\
   checksum.  whenever it does not support a parameter defined in the\
   compressed stream, it must produce a non-ambiguous error code and\
   associated error message explaining which parameter is unsupported.\
\
   this specification is intended for use by implementers of software to\
   compress data into zstandard format and/or decompress data from\
   zstandard format.  the zstandard format is supported by an open\
   source reference implementation, written in portable c, and available\
   at [zstd].\
\
3.1.  frames\
\
   zstandard compressed data is made up of one or more frames.  each\
   frame is independent and can be decompressed independently of other\
   frames.  the decompressed content of multiple concatenated frames is\
   the concatenation of each frame's decompressed content.\
\
   there are two frame formats defined for zstandard: zstandard frames\
   and skippable frames.  zstandard frames contain compressed data,\
   while skippable frames contain custom user metadata.\
\
3.1.1.  zstandard frames\
\
   the structure of a single zstandard frame is as follows:\
\
     +--------------------+------------+\
     |    magic_number    | 4 bytes    |\
     +--------------------+------------+\
     |    frame_header    | 2-14 bytes |\
     +--------------------+------------+\
     |     data_block     | n bytes    |\
     +--------------------+------------+\
     | [more data_blocks] |            |\
     +--------------------+------------+\
     | [content_checksum] | 0-4 bytes  |\
     +--------------------+------------+\
\
   magic_number:  4 bytes, little-endian format.  value: 0xfd2fb528.\
\
   frame_header:  2 to 14 bytes, detailed in section 3.1.1.1.\
\
   data_block:  detailed in section 3.1.1.2.  this is where data\
      appears.\

\
\
   content_checksum:  an optional 32-bit checksum, only present if\
      content_checksum_flag is set.  the content checksum is the result\
      of the xxh64() hash function [xxhash] digesting the original\
      (decoded) data as input, and a seed of zero.  the low 4 bytes of\
      the checksum are stored in little-endian format.\
\
   the magic number was selected to be less probable to find at the\
   beginning of an arbitrary file.  it avoids trivial patterns (0x00,\
   0xff, repeated bytes, increasing bytes, etc.), contains byte values\
   outside of ascii range, and doesn't map into utf-8 space, all of\
   which reduce the likelihood of its appearance at the top of a text\
   file.\
\
3.1.1.1.  frame header\
\
   the frame header has a variable size, with a minimum of 2 bytes and\
   up to 14 bytes depending on optional parameters.  the structure of\
   frame_header is as follows:\
\
     +-------------------------+-----------+\
     | frame_header_descriptor | 1 byte    |\
     +-------------------------+-----------+\
     |   [window_descriptor]   | 0-1 byte  |\
     +-------------------------+-----------+\
     |     [dictionary_id]     | 0-4 bytes |\
     +-------------------------+-----------+\
     |  [frame_content_size]   | 0-8 bytes |\
     +-------------------------+-----------+\

\
\
3.1.1.1.1.  frame_header_descriptor\
\
   the first header's byte is called the frame_header_descriptor.  it\
   describes which other fields are present.  decoding this byte is\
   enough to tell the size of frame_header.\
\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
     | bit number | field name              |\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
     |    7-6     | frame_content_size_flag |\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
     |     5      | single_segment_flag     |\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
     |     4      | (unused)                |\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
     |     3      | (reserved)              |\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
     |     2      | content_checksum_flag   |\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
     |    1-0     | dictionary_id_flag      |\
     +------------+-------------------------+\
\
   in this table, bit 7 is the highest bit, while bit 0 is the lowest\
   one.\
\
3.1.1.1.1.1.  frame_content_size_flag\
\
   this is a 2-bit flag (equivalent to frame_header_descriptor right-\
   shifted 6 bits) specifying whether frame_content_size (the\
   decompressed data size) is provided within the header.  flag_value\
   provides fcs_field_size, which is the number of bytes used by\
   frame_content_size according to the following table:\
\
     +----------------+--------+---+---+---+\
     | flag_value     |   0    | 1 | 2 | 3 |\
     +----------------+--------+---+---+---+\
     | fcs_field_size | 0 or 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |\
     +----------------+--------+---+---+---+\
\
   when flag_value is 0, fcs_field_size depends on single_segment_flag:\
   if single_segment_flag is set, fcs_field_size is 1.  otherwise,\
   fcs_field_size is 0; frame_content_size is not provided.\

\
\
3.1.1.1.1.2.  single_segment_flag\
\
   if this flag is set, data must be regenerated within a single\
   continuous memory segment.\
\
   in this case, window_descriptor byte is skipped, but\
   frame_content_size is necessarily present.  as a consequence, the\
   decoder must allocate a memory segment of size equal or larger than\
   frame_content_size.\
\
   in order to protect the decoder from unreasonable memory\
   requirements, a decoder is allowed to reject a compressed frame that\
   requests a memory size beyond the decoder's authorized range.\
\
   for broader compatibility, decoders are recommended to support memory\
   sizes of at least 8 mb.  this is only a recommendation; each decoder\
   is free to support higher or lower limits, depending on local\
   limitations.\
\
3.1.1.1.1.3.  unused bit\
\
   a decoder compliant with this specification version shall not\
   interpret this bit.  it might be used in a future version, to signal\
   a property that is not mandatory to properly decode the frame.  an\
   encoder compliant with this specification must set this bit to zero.\
\
3.1.1.1.1.4.  reserved bit\
\
   this bit is reserved for some future feature.  its value must be\
   zero.  a decoder compliant with this specification version must\
   ensure it is not set.  this bit may be used in a future revision, to\
   signal a feature that must be interpreted to decode the frame\
   correctly.\
\
3.1.1.1.1.5.  content_checksum_flag\
\
   if this flag is set, a 32-bit content_checksum will be present at the\
   frame's end.  see the description of content_checksum above.\

\
\
3.1.1.1.1.6.  dictionary_id_flag\
\
   this is a 2-bit flag (= frame_header_descriptor & 0x3) indicating\
   whether a dictionary id is provided within the header.  it also\
   specifies the size of this field as did_field_size:\
\
     +----------------+---+---+---+---+\
     | flag_value     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |\
     +----------------+---+---+---+---+\
     | did_field_size | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 |\
     +----------------+---+---+---+---+\
\
3.1.1.1.2.  window descriptor\
\
   this provides guarantees about the minimum memory buffer required to\
   decompress a frame.  this information is important for decoders to\
   allocate enough memory.\
\
   the window_descriptor byte is optional.  when single_segment_flag is\
   set, window_descriptor is not present.  in this case, window_size is\
   frame_content_size, which can be any value from 0 to 2^64-1 bytes (16\
   exabytes).\
\
     +------------+----------+----------+\
     | bit number |   7-3    |   2-0    |\
     +------------+----------+----------+\
     | field name | exponent | mantissa |\
     +------------+----------+----------+\
\
   the minimum memory buffer size is called window_size.  it is\
   described by the following formulae:\
\
     windowlog = 10 + exponent;\
     windowbase = 1 << windowlog;\
     windowadd = (windowbase / 8) * mantissa;\
     window_size = windowbase + windowadd;\
\
   the minimum window_size is 1 kb.  the maximum window_size is (1<<41)\
   + 7*(1<<38) bytes, which is 3.75 tb.\
\
   in general, larger window_size values tend to improve the compression\
   ratio, but at the cost of increased memory usage.\
\
   to properly decode compressed data, a decoder will need to allocate a\
   buffer of at least window_size bytes.\

   in order to protect decoders from unreasonable memory requirements, a\
   decoder is allowed to reject a compressed frame that requests a\
   memory size beyond decoder's authorized range.\
\
   for improved interoperability, it's recommended for decoders to\
   support values of window_size up to 8 mb and for encoders not to\
   generate frames requiring a window_size larger than 8 mb.  it's\
   merely a recommendation though, and decoders are free to support\
   larger or lower limits, depending on local limitations.\

   this is a variable size field, which contains the id of the\
   dictionary required to properly decode the frame.  this field is\
   optional.  when it's not present, it's up to the decoder to know\
   which dictionary to use.\
\
   dictionary_id field size is provided by did_field_size.\
   did_field_size is directly derived from the value of\
   dictionary_id_flag.  one byte can represent an id 0-255; 2 bytes can\
   represent an id 0-65535; 4 bytes can represent an id 0-4294967295.\
   format is little-endian.\
\
   it is permitted to represent a small id (for example, 13) with a\
   large 4-byte dictionary id, even if it is less efficient.\
\
   within private environments, any dictionary id can be used.  however,\
   for frames and dictionaries distributed in public space,\
   dictionary_id must be attributed carefully.  the following ranges are\
   reserved for use only with dictionaries that have been registered\
   with iana (see section 6.3):\
\
   low range:  <= 32767\
   high range:  >= (1 << 31)\
\
   any other value for dictionary_id can be used by private arrangement\
   between participants.\
\
   any payload presented for decompression that references an\
   unregistered reserved dictionary id results in an error.\

\
3.1.1.1.4.  frame content size\
\
   this is the original (uncompressed) size.  this information is\
   optional.  frame_content_size uses a variable number of bytes,\
   provided by fcs_field_size.  fcs_field_size is provided by the value\
   of frame_content_size_flag.  fcs_field_size can be equal to 0 (not\
   present), 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes.\
\
     +----------------+--------------+\
     | fcs field size | range        |\
     +----------------+--------------+\
     |        0       | unknown      |\
     +----------------+--------------+\
     |        1       | 0 - 255      |\
     +----------------+--------------+\
     |        2       | 256 - 65791  |\
     +----------------+--------------+\
     |        4       | 0 - 2^32 - 1 |\
     +----------------+--------------+\
     |        8       | 0 - 2^64 - 1 |\
     +----------------+--------------+\
\
   frame_content_size format is little-endian.  when fcs_field_size is\
   1, 4, or 8 bytes, the value is read directly.  when fcs_field_size is\
   2, the offset of 256 is added.  it's allowed to represent a small\
   size (for example 18) using any compatible variant.\
\
3.1.1.2.  blocks\
\
   after magic_number and frame_header, there are some number of blocks.\
   each frame must have at least 1 block, but there is no upper limit on\
   the number of blocks per frame.\
\
   the structure of a block is as follows:\
\
     +--------------+---------------+\
     | block_header | block_content |\
     +--------------+---------------+\
     |    3 bytes   |    n bytes    |\

\
   block_header uses 3 bytes, written using little-endian convention.\
   it contains three fields:\
\
     +------------+------------+------------+\
     | last_block | block_type | block_size |\
     +------------+------------+------------+\
     |    bit 0   |   bits 1-2 |  bits 3-23 |\
     +------------+------------+------------+\
\
3.1.1.2.1.  last_block\
\
   the lowest bit (last_block) signals whether this block is the last\
   one.  the frame will end after this last block.  it may be followed\
   by an optional content_checksum (see section 3.1.1).\
\
3.1.1.2.2.  block_type\
\
   the next 2 bits represent the block_type.  there are four block\
   types:\
\
     +-----------+------------------+\
     |   value   |    block_type    |\
     +-----------+------------------+\
     |     0     |     raw_block    |\

     |     2     | compressed_block |\
     +-----------+------------------+\
     |     3     |     reserved     |\
     +-----------+------------------+\
\
   raw_block:  this is an uncompressed block.  block_content contains\
      block_size bytes.\
\
   rle_block:  this is a single byte, repeated block_size times.\
      block_content consists of a single byte.  on the decompression\
      side, this byte must be repeated block_size times.\
\
   compressed_block:  this is a compressed block as described in\
      section 3.1.1.3.  block_size is the length of block_content,\
      namely the compressed data.  the decompressed size is not known,\
      but its maximum possible value is guaranteed (see below).\
\
   reserved:  this is not a block.  this value cannot be used with the\
      current specification.  if such a value is present, it is\
      considered to be corrupt data.\

\
\
3.1.1.2.3.  block_size\
\
   the upper 21 bits of block_header represent the block_size.\
   block_size is the size of the block excluding the header.  a block\
   can contain any number of bytes (even zero), up to\
   block_maximum_decompressed_size, which is the smallest of:\
\
   o  window_size\
\
   o  128 kb\
\
   a compressed_block has the extra restriction that block_size is\
   always strictly less than the decompressed size.  if this condition\
   cannot be respected, the block must be sent uncompressed instead\
   (i.e., treated as a raw_block).\
\
3.1.1.3.  compressed blocks\
\
   to decompress a compressed block, the compressed size must be\
   provided from the block_size field within block_header.\
\
   a compressed block consists of two sections: a literals\
   section (section 3.1.1.3.1) and a\
   sequences_section (section 3.1.1.3.2).  the results of the two\
   sections are then combined to produce the decompressed data in\
   sequence execution (section 3.1.1.4).\
\
   to decode a compressed block, the following elements are necessary:\
\
   o  previous decoded data, up to a distance of window_size, or the\
      beginning of the frame, whichever is smaller.  single_segment_flag\
      will be set in the latter case.\
\
   o  list of "recent offsets" from the previous compressed_block.\
\
   o  the previous huffman tree, required by treeless_literals_block\
      type.\
\
   o  previous finite state entropy (fse) decoding tables, required by\
      repeat_mode, for each symbol type (literals lengths, match\
      lengths, offsets).\
\
   note that decoding tables are not always from the previous\
   compressed_block:\
\
   o  every decoding table can come from a dictionary.\

   o  the huffman tree comes from the previous\
      compressed_literals_block.\
\
3.1.1.3.1.  literals_section_header\
\
   all literals are regrouped in the first part of the block.  they can\
   be decoded first and then copied during sequence execution (see\
   section 3.1.1.4), or they can be decoded on the flow during sequence\
   execution.\
\
   literals can be stored uncompressed or compressed using huffman\
   prefix codes.  when compressed, an optional tree description can be\
   present, followed by 1 or 4 streams.\

3.1.1.3.1.1.  literals_section_header\

   variable-size bit field, ranging from 1 to 5 bytes, using little-\
   endian convention.\

     +---------------------------+-------+\
\
   raw_literals_block:  literals are stored uncompressed.\
      literals_section_content is regenerated_size.\
\
   rle_literals_block:  literals consist of a single-byte value repeated\
      regenerated_size times.  literals_section_content is 1.\
\
   compressed_literals_block:  this is a standard huffman-compressed\
      block, starting with a huffman tree description.  see details\
      below.  literals_section_content is compressed_size.\
\
   treeless_literals_block:  this is a huffman-compressed block, using\
      the huffman tree from the previous compressed_literals_block, or a\
      dictionary if there is no previous huffman-compressed literals\
      block.  huffman_tree_description will be skipped.  note that if\
      this mode is triggered without any previous huffman-table in the\
      frame (or dictionary, per section 5), it should be treated as data\
      corruption.  literals_section_content is compressed_size.\
\
   the size_format is divided into two families:\
\
   o  for raw_literals_block and rle_literals_block, it's only necessary\
      to decode regenerated_size.  there is no compressed_size field.\
\
   o  for compressed_block and treeless_literals_block, it's required to\
      decode both compressed_size and regenerated_size (the decompressed\
      size).  it's also necessary to decode the number of streams (1 or\
      4).\
\
   for values spanning several bytes, the convention is little endian.\
\
   size_format for raw_literals_block and rle_literals_block uses 1 or 2\
   bits.  its value is (literals_section_header[0]>>2) & 0x3.\

\

   to represent a short value (for example, 13) using a long format,\
   even if it's less efficient.\
\
   size_format for compressed_literals_block and treeless_literals_block\
   always uses 2 bits.\
\
   size_format == 00:  a single stream.  both regenerated_size and\
      compressed_size use 10 bits (values 0-1023).\
      literals_section_header uses 3 bytes.\
\
   size_format == 01:  4 streams.  both regenerated_size and\

   regenerated_size times to generate the decoded literals.\
\
3.1.1.3.1.4.  compressed_literals_block and treeless_literals_block\
\
   both of these modes contain huffman-encoded data.  for\
   treeless_literals_block, the huffman table comes from the previously\
   compressed literals block, or from a dictionary; see section 5.\
\
3.1.1.3.1.5.  huffman_tree_description\
\
   this section is only present when the literals_block_type type is\
   compressed_literals_block (2).  the format of\
   huffman_tree_description can be found in section 4.2.1.  the size of\
   huffman_tree_description is determined during the decoding process.\
   it must be used to determine where streams begin.\
\
     total_streams_size = compressed_size\
                          - huffman_tree_description_size\
\
3.1.1.3.1.6.  jump_table\
\
   the jump_table is only present when there are 4 huffman-coded\
   streams.\
\
   (reminder: huffman-compressed data consists of either 1 or 4 huffman-\
   coded streams.)\
\
   if only 1 stream is present, it is a single bitstream occupying the\
   entire remaining portion of the literals block, encoded as described\
   within section 4.2.2.\
\
   if there are 4 streams, literals_section_header only provides enough\
   information to know the decompressed and compressed sizes of all 4\
   streams combined.  the decompressed size of each stream is equal to\
   (regenerated_size+3)/4, except for the last stream, which may be up\
   to 3 bytes smaller, to reach a total decompressed size as specified\
   in regenerated_size.\
\
   the compressed size of each stream is provided explicitly in the\
   jump_table.  the jump_table is 6 bytes long and consists of three\
   2-byte little-endian fields, describing the compressed sizes of the\
   first 3 streams.  stream4_size is computed from total_streams_size\
   minus sizes of other streams.\

\
   note that if stream1_size + stream2_size + stream3_size exceeds\
   total_streams_size, the data are considered corrupted.\
\
   each of these 4 bitstreams is then decoded independently as a\
   huffman-coded stream, as described in section 4.2.2.\
\
3.1.1.3.2.  sequences_section\
\
   a compressed block is a succession of sequences.  a sequence is a\
   literal copy command, followed by a match copy command.  a literal\
   copy command specifies a length.  it is the number of bytes to be\
   copied (or extracted) from the literals section.  a match copy\
   command specifies an offset and a length.\
\
   when all sequences are decoded, if there are literals left in the\
   literals section, these bytes are added at the end of the block.\
\
   this is described in more detail in section 3.1.1.4.\
\
   the sequences_section regroups all symbols required to decode\
   commands.  there are three symbol types: literals lengths, offsets,\
   and match lengths.  they are encoded together, interleaved, in a\
   single "bitstream".\
\
   the sequences_section starts by a header, followed by optional\
   probability tables for each symbol type, followed by the bitstream.\
\
     sequences_section_header\
       [literals_length_table]\
       [offset_table]\
       [match_length_table]\
       bitstream\
\
   to decode the sequences_section, it's necessary to know its size.\
   this size is deduced from the size of the literals_section:\
   sequences_section_size = block_size - literals_section_header -\
   literals_section_content\

   fse_compressed_mode:  standard fse compression.  a distribution table\
      will be present.  the format of this distribution table is\
      described in section 4.1.1.  note that the maximum allowed\
      accuracy log for literals length and match length tables is 9, and\
      the maximum accuracy log for the offsets table is 8.  this mode\
      must not be used when only one symbol is present; rle_mode should\
      be used instead (although any other mode will work).\
\
   repeat_mode:  the table used in the previous compressed_block with\
      number_of_sequences > 0 will be used again, or if this is the\
      first block, the table in the dictionary will be used.  note that\
      this includes rle_mode, so if repeat_mode follows rle_mode, the\
      same symbol will be repeated.  it also includes predefined_mode,\
      in which case repeat_mode will have the same outcome as\
      predefined_mode.  no distribution table will be present.  if this\
      mode is used without any previous sequence table in the frame (or\
      dictionary; see section 5) to repeat, this should be treated as\
      corruption.\

3.1.1.3.2.1.1.  sequence codes for lengths and offsets\
\
   each symbol is a code in its own context, which specifies baseline\
   and number_of_bits to add.  codes are fse compressed and interleaved\
   with raw additional bits in the same bitstream.\
\
   literals length codes are values ranging from 0 to 35 inclusive.\
   they define lengths from 0 to 131071 bytes.  the literals length is\
   equal to the decoded baseline plus the result of reading\
   number_of_bits bits from the bitstream, as a little-endian value.\

\
\
   offset codes are values ranging from 0 to n.\
\
   a decoder is free to limit its maximum supported value for n.\
   support for values of at least 22 is recommended.  at the time of\
   this writing, the reference decoder supports a maximum n value of 31.\
\
   an offset code is also the number of additional bits to read in\
   little-endian fashion and can be translated into an offset_value\
   using the following formulas:\
\
     offset_value = (1 << offsetcode) + readnbits(offsetcode);\
     if (offset_value > 3) offset = offset_value - 3;\
\
   this means that maximum offset_value is (2^(n+1))-1, supporting back-\
   reference distance up to (2^(n+1))-4, but it is limited by the\
   maximum back-reference distance (see section 3.1.1.1.2).\
\
   offset_value from 1 to 3 are special: they define "repeat codes".\
   this is described in more detail in section 3.1.1.5.\
\
3.1.1.3.2.1.2.  decoding sequences\
\
   fse bitstreams are read in reverse of the direction they are written.\
   in zstd, the compressor writes bits forward into a block, and the\
   decompressor must read the bitstream backwards.\
\
   to find the start of the bitstream, it is therefore necessary to know\
   the offset of the last byte of the block, which can be found by\
   counting block_size bytes after the block header.\
\
   after writing the last bit containing information, the compressor\
   writes a single 1 bit and then fills the byte with 0-7 zero bits of\
   padding.  the last byte of the compressed bitstream cannot be zero\
   for that reason.\
\
   when decompressing, the last byte containing the padding is the first\
   byte to read.  the decompressor needs to skip 0-7 initial zero bits\
   until the first 1 bit occurs.  afterwards, the useful part of the\
   bitstream begins.\
\
   fse decoding requires a 'state' to be carried from symbol to symbol.\
   for more explanation on fse decoding, see section 4.1.\
\
   for sequence decoding, a separate state keeps track of each literal\
   lengths, offsets, and match lengths symbols.  some fse primitives are\
   also used.  for more details on the operation of these primitives,\
   see section 4.1.\

\
\
   the bitstream starts with initial fse state values, each using the\
   required number of bits in their respective accuracy, decoded\
   previously from their normalized distribution.  it starts with\
   literals_length_state, followed by offset_state, and finally\
   match_length_state.\
\
   note that all values are read backward, so the 'start' of the\
   bitstream is at the highest position in memory, immediately before\
   the last 1 bit for padding.\
\
   after decoding the starting states, a single sequence is decoded\
   number_of_sequences times.  these sequences are decoded in order from\
   first to last.  since the compressor writes the bitstream in the\
   forward direction, this means the compressor must encode the\
   sequences starting with the last one and ending with the first.\
\
   for each of the symbol types, the fse state can be used to determine\
   the appropriate code.  the code then defines the baseline and\
   number_of_bits to read for each type.  the description of the codes\
   for how to determine these values can be found in\
   section 3.1.1.3.2.1.\
\
   decoding starts by reading the number_of_bits required to decode\
   offset.  it does the same for match_length and then for\
   literals_length.  this sequence is then used for sequence execution\
   (see section 3.1.1.4).\
\
   if it is not the last sequence in the block, the next operation is to\
   update states.  using the rules pre-calculated in the decoding\
   tables, literals_length_state is updated, followed by\
   match_length_state, and then offset_state.  see section 4.1 for\
   details on how to update states from the bitstream.\
\
   this operation will be repeated number_of_sequences times.  at the\
   end, the bitstream shall be entirely consumed; otherwise, the\
   bitstream is considered corrupted.\
\
3.1.1.3.2.2.  default distributions\
\
   if predefined_mode is selected for a symbol type, its fse decoding\
   table is generated from a predefined distribution table defined here.\
   for details on how to convert this distribution into a decoding\
   table, see section 4.1.\

         -1,-1,-1,-1,-1\
       };\
\
3.1.1.3.2.2.3.  offset codes\
\
   the decoding table uses an accuracy log of 5 bits (32 states), and\
   supports a maximum n value of 28, allowing offset values up to\
   536,870,908.\
\
   if any sequence in the compressed block requires a larger offset than\
   this, it's not possible to use the default distribution to represent\
   it.\
\
     short offsetcodes_defaultdistribution[29] =\
       { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,\
         1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\
       };\
\
3.1.1.4.  sequence execution\
\
   once literals and sequences have been decoded, they are combined to\
   produce the decoded content of a block.\
\
   each sequence consists of a tuple of (literals_length, offset_value,\
   match_length), decoded as described in the\
   sequences_section (section 3.1.1.3.2).  to execute a sequence, first\
   copy literals_length bytes from the decoded literals to the output.\
\

\
\
   then, match_length bytes are copied from previous decoded data.  the\
   offset to copy from is determined by offset_value:\
\
   o  if offset_value > 3, then the offset is offset_value - 3;\
\
   o  if offset_value is from 1-3, the offset is a special repeat offset\
      value.  see section 3.1.1.5 for how the offset is determined in\
      this case.\
\
   the offset is defined as from the current position (after copying the\
   literals), so an offset of 6 and a match length of 3 means that 3\
   bytes should be copied from 6 bytes back.  note that all offsets\
   leading to previously decoded data must be smaller than window_size\
   defined in frame_header_descriptor (section 3.1.1.1.1).\
\
3.1.1.5.  repeat offsets\
\
   as seen above, the first three values define a repeated offset; we\
   will call them repeated_offset1, repeated_offset2, and\
   repeated_offset3.  they are sorted in recency order, with\
   repeated_offset1 meaning "most recent one".\
\
   if offset_value is 1, then the offset used is repeated_offset1, etc.\
\
   there is one exception: when the current sequence's literals_length\
   is 0, repeated offsets are shifted by 1, so an offset_value of 1\
   means repeated_offset2, an offset_value of 2 means repeated_offset3,\
   and an offset_value of 3 means repeated_offset1 - 1_byte.\
\
   for the first block, the starting offset history is populated with\
   the following values: repeated_offset1 (1), repeated_offset2 (4), and\
   repeated_offset3 (8), unless a dictionary is used, in which case they\
   come from the dictionary.\
\
   then each block gets its starting offset history from the ending\
   values of the most recent compressed_block.  note that blocks that\
   are not compressed_block are skipped; they do not contribute to\
   offset history.\
\
   the newest offset takes the lead in offset history, shifting others\
   back (up to its previous place if it was already present).  this\
   means that when repeated_offset1 (most recent) is used, history is\
   unmodified.  when repeated_offset2 is used, it is swapped with\
   repeated_offset1.  if any other offset is used, it becomes\
   repeated_offset1, and the rest are shifted back by 1.\

3.1.2.  skippable frames\
\
     +--------------+------------+-----------+\
     | magic_number | frame_size | user_data |\

     |    4 bytes   |   4 bytes  |  n bytes  |\
     +--------------+------------+-----------+\
\
   skippable frames allow the insertion of user-defined metadata into a\
   flow of concatenated frames.\
\
   skippable frames defined in this specification are compatible with\
   skippable frames in [lz4].\
\
   from a compliant decoder perspective, skippable frames simply need to\
   be skipped, and their content ignored, resuming decoding after the\
   skippable frame.\
\
   it should be noted that a skippable frame can be used to watermark a\
   stream of concatenated frames embedding any kind of tracking\
   information (even just a universally unique identifier (uuid)).\
   users wary of such possibility should scan the stream of concatenated\
   frames in an attempt to detect such frames for analysis or removal.\
\
   the fields are:\
\
   magic_number:  4 bytes, little-endian format.  value: 0x184d2a5?,\
      which means any value from 0x184d2a50 to 0x184d2a5f.  all 16\
      values are valid to identify a skippable frame.  this\
      specification does not detail any specific tagging methods for\
      skippable frames.\
\
   frame_size:  this is the size, in bytes, of the following user_data\
      (without including the magic number nor the size field itself).\
      this field is represented using 4 bytes, little-endian format,\
      unsigned 32 bits.  this means user_data can't be bigger than\
      (2^32-1) bytes.\
\
   user_data:  this field can be anything.  data will just be skipped by\
      the decoder.\
\
4.  entropy encoding\
\
   two types of entropy encoding are used by the zstandard format: fse\
   and huffman coding.  huffman is used to compress literals, while fse\
   is used for all other symbols (literals_length_code,\
   match_length_code, and offset codes) and to compress huffman headers.\

\
\
4.1.  fse\
\
   fse, short for finite state entropy, is an entropy codec based on\
   [ans].  fse encoding/decoding involves a state that is carried over\
   between symbols, so decoding must be done in the opposite direction\
   as encoding.  therefore, all fse bitstreams are read from end to\
   beginning.  note that the order of the bits in the stream is not\
   reversed; they are simply read in the reverse order from which they\
   were written.\
\
   for additional details on fse, see finite state entropy [fse].\
\
   fse decoding involves a decoding table that has a power of 2 size and\
   contains three elements: symbol, num_bits, and baseline.  the base 2\
   logarithm of the table size is its accuracy_log.  an fse state value\
   represents an index in this table.\
\
   to obtain the initial state value, consume accuracy_log bits from the\
   stream as a little-endian value.  the next symbol in the stream is\
   the symbol indicated in the table for that state.  to obtain the next\
   state value, the decoder should consume num_bits bits from the stream\
   as a little-endian value and add it to baseline.\
\
4.1.1.  fse table description\
\
   to decode fse streams, it is necessary to construct the decoding\
   table.  the zstandard format encodes fse table descriptions as\
   described here.\
\
   an fse distribution table describes the probabilities of all symbols\
   from 0 to the last present one (included) on a normalized scale of\
   (1 << accuracy_log).  note that there must be two or more symbols\
   with non-zero probability.\
\
   a bitstream is read forward, in little-endian fashion.  it is not\
   necessary to know its exact size, since the size will be discovered\
   and reported by the decoding process.  the bitstream starts by\
   reporting on which scale it operates.  if low4bits designates the\
   lowest 4 bits of the first byte, then accuracy_log = low4bits + 5.\

\
\
   this is followed by each symbol value, from 0 to the last present\
   one.  the number of bits used by each field is variable and depends\
   on:\
\
   remaining probabilities + 1:  for example, presuming an accuracy_log\
      of 8, and presuming 100 probabilities points have already been\
      distributed, the decoder may read any value from 0 to\
      (256 - 100 + 1) == 157, inclusive.  therefore, it must read\
      log2sup(157) == 8 bits.\
\
   value decoded:  small values use 1 fewer bit.  for example, presuming\
      values from 0 to 157 (inclusive) are possible, 255 - 157 = 98\
      values are remaining in an 8-bit field.  the first 98 values\
      (hence from 0 to 97) use only 7 bits, and values from 98 to 157\
      use 8 bits.  this is achieved through this scheme:\
\
     +------------+---------------+-----------+\
     | value read | value decoded | bits used |\
     +------------+---------------+-----------+\
     |   0 - 97   |     0 - 97    |     7     |\
     +------------+---------------+-----------+\
     |  98 - 127  |    98 - 127   |     8     |\
     +------------+---------------+-----------+\
     | 128 - 225  |     0 - 97    |     7     |\
     +------------+---------------+-----------+\
     | 226 - 255  |   128 - 157   |     8     |\
     +------------+---------------+-----------+\
\
   symbol probabilities are read one by one, in order.  the probability\
   is obtained from value decoded using the formula p = value - 1.  this\
   means the value 0 becomes the negative probability -1.  this is a\
   special probability that means "less than 1".  its effect on the\
   distribution table is described below.  for the purpose of\
   calculating total allocated probability points, it counts as 1.\
\
   when a symbol has a probability of zero, it is followed by a 2-bit\
   repeat flag.  this repeat flag tells how many probabilities of zeroes\
   follow the current one.  it provides a number ranging from 0 to 3.\
   if it is a 3, another 2-bit repeat flag follows, and so on.\
\
   when the last symbol reaches a cumulated total of\
   (1 << accuracy_log), decoding is complete.  if the last symbol makes\
   the cumulated total go above (1 << accuracy_log), distribution is\
   considered corrupted.\

\
\
   finally, the decoder can tell how many bytes were used in this\
   process and how many symbols are present.  the bitstream consumes a\
   round number of bytes.  any remaining bit within the last byte is\
   simply unused.\
\
   the distribution of normalized probabilities is enough to create a\
   unique decoding table.  the table has a size of (1 << accuracy_log).\
   each cell describes the symbol decoded and instructions to get the\
   next state.\
\
   symbols are scanned in their natural order for "less than 1"\
   probabilities as described above.  symbols with this probability are\
   being attributed a single cell, starting from the end of the table\
   and retreating.  these symbols define a full state reset, reading\
   accuracy_log bits.\
\
   all remaining symbols are allocated in their natural order.  starting\
   from symbol 0 and table position 0, each symbol gets allocated as\
   many cells as its probability.  cell allocation is spread, not\
   linear; each successor position follows this rule:\
\
     position += (tablesize >> 1) + (tablesize >> 3) + 3;\
     position &= tablesize - 1;\
\
   a position is skipped if it is already occupied by a "less than 1"\
   probability symbol.  position does not reset between symbols; it\
   simply iterates through each position in the table, switching to the\
   next symbol when enough states have been allocated to the current\
   one.\
\
   the result is a list of state values.  each state will decode the\
   current symbol.\
\
   to get the number_of_bits and baseline required for the next state,\
   it is first necessary to sort all states in their natural order.  the\
   lower states will need 1 more bit than higher ones.  the process is\
   repeated for each symbol.\
\
   for example, presuming a symbol has a probability of 5, it receives\
   five state values.  states are sorted in natural order.  the next\
   power of 2 is 8.  the space of probabilities is divided into 8 equal\
   parts.  presuming the accuracy_log is 7, this defines 128 states, and\
   each share (divided by 8) is 16 in size.  in order to reach 8, 8 - 5\
   = 3 lowest states will count "double", doubling the number of shares\
   (32 in width), requiring 1 more bit in the process.\

\
\
   baseline is assigned starting from the higher states using fewer\
   bits, and proceeding naturally, then resuming at the first state,\
   each taking its allocated width from baseline.\

\
   the next state is determined from the current state by reading the\
   required number_of_bits and adding the specified baseline.\
\
   see appendix a for the results of this process that are applied to\
   the default distributions.\
\
4.2.  huffman coding\
\
   zstandard huffman-coded streams are read backwards, similar to the\
   fse bitstreams.  therefore, to find the start of the bitstream, it is\
   necessary to know the offset of the last byte of the huffman-coded\
   stream.\
\
   after writing the last bit containing information, the compressor\
   writes a single 1 bit and then fills the byte with 0-7 0 bits of\
   padding.  the last byte of the compressed bitstream cannot be 0 for\
   that reason.\
\
   when decompressing, the last byte containing the padding is the first\
   byte to read.  the decompressor needs to skip 0-7 initial 0 bits and\
   the first 1 bit that occurs.  afterwards, the useful part of the\
   bitstream begins.\
\
   the bitstream contains huffman-coded symbols in little-endian order,\
   with the codes defined by the method below.\

\
4.2.1.  huffman tree description\
\
   prefix coding represents symbols from an a priori known alphabet by\
   bit sequences (codewords), one codeword for each symbol, in a manner\
   such that different symbols may be represented by bit sequences of\
   different lengths, but a parser can always parse an encoded string\
   unambiguously symbol by symbol.\
\
   given an alphabet with known symbol frequencies, the huffman\
   algorithm allows the construction of an optimal prefix code using the\
   fewest bits of any possible prefix codes for that alphabet.\
\
   the prefix code must not exceed a maximum code length.  more bits\
   improve accuracy but yield a larger header size and require more\
   memory or more complex decoding operations.  this specification\
   limits the maximum code length to 11 bits.\
\
   all literal values from zero (included) to the last present one\
   (excluded) are represented by weight with values from 0 to\
   max_number_of_bits.  transformation from weight to number_of_bits\
   follows this pseudocode:\
\
     if weight == 0\
       number_of_bits = 0\
     else\
       number_of_bits = max_number_of_bits + 1 - weight\
\
   the last symbol's weight is deduced from previously decoded ones, by\
   completing to the nearest power of 2.  this power of 2 gives\
   max_number_of_bits the depth of the current tree.\
\
   for example, presume the following huffman tree must be described:\
\
     +---------------+----------------+\
     | literal value | number_of_bits |\
     +---------------+----------------+\
     |       0       |        1       |\
     +---------------+----------------+\
     |       1       |        2       |\
     +---------------+----------------+\
     |       2       |        3       |\
     +---------------+----------------+\
     |       3       |        0       |\
     +---------------+----------------+\
     |       4       |        4       |\
     +---------------+----------------+\
     |       5       |        4       |\

\
\
   the tree depth is 4, since its longest element uses 4 bits.  (the\
   longest elements are those with the smallest frequencies.)  value 5\
   will not be listed as it can be determined from the values for 0-4,\
   nor will values above 5 as they are all 0.  values from 0 to 4 will\
   be listed using weight instead of number_of_bits.  the pseudocode to\
   determine weight is:\
\
     if number_of_bits == 0\
       weight = 0\
     else\
       weight = max_number_of_bits + 1 - number_of_bits\
\
   it gives the following series of weights:\
\
     +---------------+--------+\
     | literal value | weight |\
     +---------------+--------+\
     |       0       |   4    |\
     +---------------+--------+\
     |       1       |   3    |\
     +---------------+--------+\
     |       2       |   2    |\
     +---------------+--------+\
     |       3       |   0    |\
     +---------------+--------+\
     |       4       |   1    |\
     +---------------+--------+\
\
   the decoder will do the inverse operation: having collected weights\
   of literals from 0 to 4, it knows the last literal, 5, is present\
   with a non-zero weight.  the weight of 5 can be determined by\
   advancing to the next power of 2.  the sum of 2^(weight-1) (excluding\
   0's) is 15.  the nearest power of 2 is 16.  therefore,\
   max_number_of_bits = 4 and weight[5] = 16 - 15 = 1.\
\
4.2.1.1.  huffman tree header\
\
   this is a single byte value (0-255), which describes how the series\
   of weights is encoded.\
\
   headerbyte < 128:  the series of weights is compressed using fse (see\
      below).  the length of the fse-compressed series is equal to\
      headerbyte (0-127).\

\
\
   headerbyte >= 128:  this is a direct representation, where each\
      weight is written directly as a 4-bit field (0-15).  they are\
      encoded forward, 2 weights to a byte with the first weight taking\
      the top 4 bits and the second taking the bottom 4; for example,\
      the following operations could be used to read the weights:\
\
     weight[0] = (byte[0] >> 4)\
     weight[1] = (byte[0] & 0xf),\
     etc.\
\
      the full representation occupies ceiling(number_of_symbols/2)\
      bytes, meaning it uses only full bytes even if number_of_symbols\
      is odd.  number_of_symbols = headerbyte - 127.  note that maximum\
      number_of_symbols is 255 - 127 = 128.  if any literal has a value\
      over 128, raw header mode is not possible, and it is necessary to\
      use fse compression.\
\
4.2.1.2.  fse compression of huffman weights\
\
   in this case, the series of huffman weights is compressed using fse\
   compression.  it is a single bitstream with two interleaved states,\
   sharing a single distribution table.\
\
   to decode an fse bitstream, it is necessary to know its compressed\
   size.  compressed size is provided by headerbyte.  it's also\
   necessary to know its maximum possible decompressed size, which is\
   255, since literal values span from 0 to 255, and the last symbol's\
   weight is not represented.\
\
   an fse bitstream starts by a header, describing probabilities\
   distribution.  it will create a decoding table.  for a list of\
   huffman weights, the maximum accuracy log is 6 bits.  for more\
   details, see section 4.1.1.\
\
   the huffman header compression uses two states, which share the same\
   fse distribution table.  the first state (state1) encodes the even-\
   numbered index symbols, and the second (state2) encodes the odd-\
   numbered index symbols.  state1 is initialized first, and then\
   state2, and they take turns decoding a single symbol and updating\
   their state.  for more details on these fse operations, see\
   section 4.1.\
\
   the number of symbols to be decoded is determined by tracking the\
   bitstream overflow condition: if updating state after decoding a\
   symbol would require more bits than remain in the stream, it is\
   assumed that extra bits are zero.  then, symbols for each of the\
   final states are decoded and the process is complete.\

\
\
4.2.1.3.  conversion from weights to huffman prefix codes\
\
   all present symbols will now have a weight value.  it is possible to\
   transform weights into number_of_bits, using this formula:\
\
     if weight > 0\
         number_of_bits = max_number_of_bits + 1 - weight\
     else\
         number_of_bits = 0\
\
   symbols are sorted by weight.  within the same weight, symbols keep\
   natural sequential order.  symbols with a weight of zero are removed.\
   then, starting from the lowest weight, prefix codes are distributed\
   in sequential order.\
\
   for example, assume the following list of weights has been decoded:\
\
     +---------+--------+\
     | literal | weight |\
     +---------+--------+\
     |    0    |   4    |\
     +---------+--------+\
     |    1    |   3    |\
     +---------+--------+\
     |    2    |   2    |\
     +---------+--------+\
     |    3    |   0    |\
     +---------+--------+\
     |    4    |   1    |\
     +---------+--------+\
     |    5    |   1    |\
     +---------+--------+\

   following distribution:\

\
4.2.2.  huffman-coded streams\
\
   given a huffman decoding table, it is possible to decode a huffman-\
   coded stream.\
\
   each bitstream must be read backward, which starts from the end and\
   goes up to the beginning.  therefore, it is necessary to know the\
   size of each bitstream.\
\
   it is also necessary to know exactly which bit is the last.  this is\
   detected by a final bit flag: the highest bit of the last byte is a\
   final-bit-flag.  consequently, a last byte of 0 is not possible.  and\
   the final-bit-flag itself is not part of the useful bitstream.\
   hence, the last byte contains between 0 and 7 useful bits.\
\
   starting from the end, it is possible to read the bitstream in a\
   little-endian fashion, keeping track of already used bits.  since the\
   bitstream is encoded in reverse order, starting from the end, read\
   symbols in forward order.\

\
\
   for example, if the literal sequence "0145" was encoded using the\
   above prefix code, it would be encoded (in reverse order) as:\
\
     +---------+----------+\
     | symbol  | encoding |\
     +---------+----------+\
     |    5    |   0000   |\
     +---------+----------+\
     |    4    |   0001   |\
     +---------+----------+\
     |    1    |    01    |\
     +---------+----------+\
     |    0    |    1     |\
     +---------+----------+\
     | padding |   00001  |\
     +---------+----------+\
\
   this results in the following 2-byte bitstream:\
\
     00010000 00001101\
\
   here is an alternative representation with the symbol codes separated\
   by underscores:\
\
     0001_0000 00001_1_01\
\
   reading the highest max_number_of_bits bits, it's possible to compare\
   the extracted value to the decoding table, determining the symbol to\
   decode and number of bits to discard.\
\
   the process continues reading up to the required number of symbols\
   per stream.  if a bitstream is not entirely and exactly consumed,\
   hence reaching exactly its beginning position with all bits consumed,\
   the decoding process is considered faulty.\
\
5.  dictionary format\
\
   zstandard is compatible with "raw content" dictionaries, free of any\
   format restriction, except that they must be at least 8 bytes.  these\
   dictionaries function as if they were just the content part of a\
   formatted dictionary.\
\
   however, dictionaries created by "zstd --train" in the reference\
   implementation follow a specific format, described here.\
\
   dictionaries are not included in the compressed content but rather\
   are provided out of band.  that is, the dictionary_id identifies\
   which should be used, but this specification does not describe the\

\
\
   mechanism by which the dictionary is obtained prior to use during\
   compression or decompression.\
\
   a dictionary has a size, defined either by a buffer limit or a file\
   size.  the general format is:\
\
     +--------------+---------------+----------------+---------+\
     | magic_number | dictionary_id | entropy_tables | content |\
     +--------------+---------------+----------------+---------+\
\
   magic_number:  4 bytes id, value 0xec30a437, little-endian format.\
\
   dictionary_id:  4 bytes, stored in little-endian format.\
      dictionary_id can be any value, except 0 (which means no\
      dictionary_id).  it is used by decoders to check if they use the\
      correct dictionary.  if the frame is going to be distributed in a\
      private environment, any dictionary_id can be used.  however, for\
      public distribution of compressed frames, the following ranges are\
      reserved and shall not be used:\
\
         low range: <= 32767\
         high range: >= (2^31)\
\
   entropy_tables:  follow the same format as the tables in compressed\
      blocks.  see the relevant fse and huffman sections for how to\
      decode these tables.  they are stored in the following order:\
      huffman table for literals, fse table for offsets, fse table for\
      match lengths, and fse table for literals lengths.  these tables\
      populate the repeat stats literals mode and repeat distribution\
      mode for sequence decoding.  it is finally followed by 3 offset\
      values, populating repeat offsets (instead of using {1,4,8}),\
      stored in order, 4-bytes little-endian each, for a total of 12\
      bytes.  each repeat offset must have a value less than the\
      dictionary size.\
\
   content:  the rest of the dictionary is its content.  the content\
      acts as a "past" in front of data to be compressed or\
      decompressed, so it can be referenced in sequence commands.  as\
      long as the amount of data decoded from this frame is less than or\
      equal to window_size, sequence commands may specify offsets longer\
      than the total length of decoded output so far to reference back\
      to the dictionary, even parts of the dictionary with offsets\
      larger than window_size.  after the total output has surpassed\
      window_size, however, this is no longer allowed, and the\
      dictionary is no longer accessible.\

6.  iana considerations\
\
   iana has made two registrations, as described below.\
\
6.1.  the 'application/zstd' media type\
\
   the 'application/zstd' media type identifies a block of data that is\
   compressed using zstd compression.  the data is a stream of bytes as\
   described in this document.  iana has added the following to the\
   "media types" registry:\
\
   type name:  application\
\
   subtype name:  zstd\
\
   required parameters:  n/a\
\
   optional parameters:  n/a\
\
   encoding considerations:  binary\
\
   security considerations:  see section 7 of rfc 8478\
\
   interoperability considerations:  n/a\
\
   published specification:  rfc 8478\
\
   applications that use this media type:  anywhere data size is an\
      issue\
\
   additional information:\
\
      magic number(s):  4 bytes, little-endian format.\
         value: 0xfd2fb528\
\
      file extension(s):  zst\
\
      macintosh file type code(s):  n/a\

\
\
   provisional registration:  no\
\
6.2.  content encoding\
\
   iana has added the following entry to the "http content coding\
   registry" within the "hypertext transfer protocol (http) parameters"\
   registry:\
\
   name:  zstd\
\
   description:  a stream of bytes compressed using the zstandard\
      protocol\
\
   pointer to specification text:  rfc 8478\
\
6.3.  dictionaries\
\
   work in progress includes development of dictionaries that will\
   optimize compression and decompression of particular types of data.\
   specification of such dictionaries for public use will necessitate\
   registration of a code point from the reserved range described in\
   section 3.1.1.1.3 and its association with a specific dictionary.\
\
   however, there are at present no such dictionaries published for\
   public use, so this document makes no immediate request of iana to\
   create such a registry.\
\
7.  security considerations\
\
   any data compression method involves the reduction of redundancy in\
   the data.  zstandard is no exception, and the usual precautions\
   apply.\
\
   one should never compress a message whose content must remain secret\
   with a message generated by a third party.  such a compression can be\
   used to guess the content of the secret message through analysis of\
   entropy reduction.  this was demonstrated in the compression ratio\
   info-leak made easy (crime) attack [crime], for example.\
\
   a decoder has to demonstrate capabilities to detect and prevent any\
   kind of data tampering in the compressed frame from triggering system\
   faults, such as reading or writing beyond allowed memory ranges.\
   this can be guaranteed by either the implementation language or\
   careful bound checkings.  of particular note is the encoding of\
   number_of_sequences values that cause the decoder to read into the\
   block header (and beyond), as well as the indication of a\
   frame_content_size that is smaller than the actual decompressed data,\
   in an attempt to trigger a buffer overflow.  it is highly recommended\

\
\
   to fuzz-test (i.e., provide invalid, unexpected, or random input and\
   verify safe operation of) decoder implementations to test and harden\
   their capability to detect bad frames and deal with them without any\
   adverse system side effect.\
\
   an attacker may provide correctly formed compressed frames with\
   unreasonable memory requirements.  a decoder must always control\
   memory requirements and enforce some (system-specific) limits in\
   order to protect memory usage from such scenarios.\
\
   compression can be optimized by training a dictionary on a variety of\
   related content payloads.  this dictionary must then be available at\
   the decoder for decompression of the payload to be possible.  while\
   this document does not specify how to acquire a dictionary for a\
   given compressed payload, it is worth noting that third-party\
   dictionaries may interact unexpectedly with a decoder, leading to\
   possible memory or other resource exhaustion attacks.  we expect such\
   topics to be discussed in further detail in the security\
   considerations section of a forthcoming rfc for dictionary\
   acquisition and transmission, but highlight this issue now out of an\
   abundance of caution.\
\
   as discussed in section 3.1.2, it is possible to store arbitrary user\
   metadata in skippable frames.  while such frames are ignored during\
   decompression of the data, they can be used as a watermark to track\
   the path of the compressed payload.\
\
8.  implementation status\
\
   source code for a c language implementation of a zstandard-compliant\
   library is available at [zstd-github].  this implementation is\
   considered to be the reference implementation and is production\
   ready; it implements the full range of the specification.  it is\
   routinely tested against security hazards and widely deployed within\
   facebook infrastructure.\
\
   the reference version is optimized for speed and is highly portable.\
   it has been proven to run safely on multiple architectures (e.g.,\
   x86, x64, arm, mips, powerpc, ia64) featuring 32- or 64-bit\
   addressing schemes, a little- or big-endian storage scheme, a number\
   of different operating systems (e.g., unix (including linux, bsd,\
   os-x, and solaris) and windows), and a number of compilers (e.g.,\
   gcc, clang, visual, and icc).\

appendix a.  decoding tables for predefined codes\
\
   this appendix contains fse decoding tables for the predefined literal\
   length, match length, and offset codes.  the tables have been\
   constructed using the algorithm as given above in section 4.1.1.  the\
   tables here can be used as examples to crosscheck that an\

             6tisch operation sublayer (6top) protocol (6p)\
\
abstract\
\
   this document defines the "ipv6 over the tsch mode of ieee 802.15.4e"\
   (6tisch) operation sublayer (6top) protocol (6p), which enables\
   distributed scheduling in 6tisch networks.  6p allows neighbor nodes\
   to add/delete time-slotted channel hopping (tsch) cells to/on one\
   another.  6p is part of the 6tisch operation sublayer (6top), the\
   layer just above the ieee std 802.15.4 tsch medium access control\
   layer.  6top is composed of one or more scheduling functions (sfs)\
   and the 6top protocol defined in this document.  a 6top sf decides\
   when to add/delete cells, and it triggers 6p transactions.  the\
   definition of sfs is out of scope for this document; however, this\
   document provides the requirements for an sf.\

1.  introduction\
\
   all communication in an "ipv6 over the tsch mode of ieee 802.15.4e"\
   (6tisch) network is orchestrated by a schedule [rfc7554].  the\
   schedule is composed of cells, each identified by a\
   [slotoffset,channeloffset] (section 3.2.4).  this specification\
   defines the 6tisch operation sublayer (6top) protocol (6p), which is\
   terminated by 6top.  6p allows a node to communicate with a neighbor\
   node to add/delete time-slotted channel hopping (tsch) cells to/on\
   one another.  this results in distributed schedule management in a\
   6tisch network.  6top is composed of one or more scheduling functions\
   (sfs) and the 6top protocol defined in this document.  the definition\
   of sfs is out of scope for this document; however, this document\
   provides the requirements for an sf.\

\
\
   the example network depicted in figure 1 is used to describe the\
   interaction between nodes.  we consider the canonical case where\
   node "a" issues 6p requests (also referred to as "commands" in this\
   document) to node "b".  we use this example throughout this document:\
   node a always represents the node that issues a 6p request, and\
   node b represents the node that receives this request.\

                                (a)     (d)\
\
                     figure 1: a simple 6tisch network\
\
   we consider that node a monitors the communication cells it has in\
   its schedule to node b:\
\
   o  if node a determines that the number of link-layer frames it is\
      sending to node b per unit of time exceeds the capacity offered by\
      the tsch cells it has scheduled to node b, it triggers a 6p\
      transaction with node b to add one or more cells to the tsch\
      schedule of both nodes.\
\
   o  if the traffic is lower than the capacity offered by the tsch\
      cells it has scheduled to node b, node a triggers a 6p transaction\
      with node b to delete one or more cells in the tsch schedule of\
      both nodes.\
\
   o  node a may also monitor statistics to determine whether collisions\
      are happening on a particular cell to node b.  if this feature is\
      enabled, node a communicates with node b to "relocate" this\
      particular cell to a different [slotoffset,channeloffset] location\
      in the tsch schedule.\
\
   this results in distributed schedule management in a 6tisch network.\
\
   the 6top sf defines when to add/delete a cell to/on a neighbor.\
   different applications require different sfs; this topic is out of\
   scope for this document.  different sfs are expected to be defined in\
   future companion specifications.  a node may implement multiple sfs\
   and run them at the same time.  at least one sf must be running.  the\
   sfid field contained in all 6p messages allows a node to invoke the\
   appropriate sf on a per-6p transaction basis.\

1.1.  requirements language\
\
   the key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",\
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "not recommended", "may", and\
   "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   bcp 14 [rfc2119] [rfc8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
2.  6tisch operation sublayer (6top)\
\
   as depicted in figure 2, 6top is the layer just above the ieee std\
   802.15.4 tsch medium access control (mac) layer [ieee802154].  we use\
   "802.15.4" as a short version of "ieee std 802.15.4" in this\

   the roles of 6top are to:\
\
   o  terminate 6p, which allows neighbor nodes to communicate to\
      add/delete cells to/on one another.\
\
   o  run one or multiple 6top sfs, which define the rules that decide\
      when to add/delete cells.\

\
2.1.  hard/soft cells\
\
   each cell in the schedule is either "hard" or "soft":\
\
   o  a soft cell can be read, added, deleted, or updated by 6top.\
\
   o  a hard cell is read-only for 6top.\
\
   in the context of this specification, all the cells used by 6top are\
   soft cells.  hard cells can be used, for example, when "hard-coding"\
   a schedule [rfc8180].\
\
2.2.  using 6p with the minimal 6tisch configuration\
\
   6p may be used alongside the minimal 6tisch configuration [rfc8180].\
   in this case, it is recommended to use two slotframes, as depicted in\
   figure 3:\
\
   o  slotframe 0 is used for traffic defined in the minimal 6tisch\
      configuration.  in figure 3, slotframe 0 is five slots long, but\
      it can be shorter or longer.\
\
   o  6p allocates cells from slotframe 1.  in figure 3, slotframe 1 is\
      10 slots long, but it can be shorter or longer.\

\
   the minimal 6tisch configuration cell should be allocated from a\
   slotframe of higher priority than the slotframe used by 6p for\
   dynamic cell allocation.  this way, dynamically allocated cells\
   cannot "mask" the cells used by the minimal 6tisch configuration.\
   6top may support additional slotframes; how to use additional\
   slotframes is out of scope for this document.\

\
\
3.  6top protocol (6p)\
\
   6p enables two neighbor nodes to add/delete/relocate cells in their\
   tsch schedule.  conceptually, two neighbor nodes "negotiate" the\
   location of the cells to add, delete, or relocate in their tsch\
   schedule.\
\
3.1.  6p transactions\
\
   we call "6p transaction" a complete negotiation between two neighbor\
   nodes.  a particular 6p transaction is executed between two nodes as\
   a result of an action triggered by one sf.  for a 6p transaction to\
   succeed, both nodes must use the same sf to handle the particular\
   transaction.  a 6p transaction starts when a node wishes to\
   add/delete/relocate one or more cells with one of its neighbors.  a\
   6p transaction ends when (1) the cell(s) has been added/deleted/\
   relocated in the schedule of both nodes or (2) the 6p transaction has\
   failed.\
\
   6p messages exchanged between nodes a and b during a 6p transaction\
   should be exchanged on non-shared unicast cells ("dedicated" cells)\
   between nodes a and b.  if no dedicated cells are scheduled between\
   nodes a and b, shared cells may be used.\
\
   keeping consistency between the schedules of the two neighbor nodes\
   is important.  a loss of consistency can cause loss of connectivity.\
   one example is when node a has a transmit cell to node b but node b\
   does not have the corresponding reception cell.  to verify\
   consistency, neighbor nodes maintain a sequence number (seqnum).\
   neighbor nodes exchange the seqnum as part of each 6p transaction to\
   detect a possible inconsistency.  this mechanism is explained in\
   section 3.4.6.2.\
\
   an implementation must include a mechanism to associate each\
   scheduled cell with the sf that scheduled it.  this mechanism is\
   implementation specific and is out of scope for this document.\
\
   a 6p transaction can consist of two or three steps.  a 2-step\
   transaction is used when node a selects the cells to be allocated.  a\
   3-step transaction is used when node b selects the cells to be\
   allocated.  an sf must specify whether to use 2-step transactions,\
   3-step transactions, or both.\
\
   we illustrate 2-step and 3-step transactions using the topology in\
   figure 1.\

\
   in this example, the 2-step transaction occurs as follows:\
\
   1.  the sf running on node a determines that two extra cells need to\
       be scheduled to node b.\
\
   2.  the sf running on node a selects candidate cells for node b to\
       choose from.  node a must select at least as many candidate cells\
       as the number of cells to add.  here, node a selects three\
       candidate cells.  node a locks those candidate cells in its\
       schedule until it receives a 6p response.\

\
\
   3.  node a sends a 6p add request to node b, indicating that it\
       wishes to add two cells (the "numcells" value) and specifying the\
       list of three candidate cells (the "celllist" value).  each cell\
       in the celllist is a [slotoffset,channeloffset] tuple.  this 6p\
       add request is link-layer acknowledged by node b (labeled "l2\
       ack" in figure 4).\
\
   4.  after having successfully sent the 6p add request (i.e.,\
       receiving the link-layer acknowledgment), node a starts a 6p\
       timeout to abort the 6p transaction in the event that no response\
       is received from node b.\
\
   5.  the sf running on node b selects two out of the three cells from\
       the celllist of the 6p add request.  node b locks those cells in\
       its schedule until the transmission is successful (i.e., node b\
       receives a link-layer ack from node a).  node b sends back a 6p\
       response to node a, indicating the cells it has selected.  the\
       response is link-layer acknowledged by node a.\
\
   6.  upon completion of this 6p transaction, two cells from node a to\
       node b have been added to the tsch schedule of both nodes a\
       and b.\
\
   7.  an inconsistency in the schedule can happen if the 6p timeout\
       expires when the 6p response is in the air, if the last\
       link-layer ack for the 6p response is lost, or if one of the\
       nodes is power-cycled during the transaction.  6p provides an\
       inconsistency detection mechanism to cope with such situations;\
       see section 3.4.6.2 for details.\

\
\
   in this example, the 3-step transaction occurs as follows:\
\
   1.  the sf running on node a determines that two extra cells need to\
       be scheduled to node b.  the sf uses a 3-step transaction, so it\
       does not select candidate cells.\
\
   2.  node a sends a 6p add request to node b, indicating that it\
       wishes to add two cells (the "numcells" value), with an empty\
       "celllist".  this 6p add request is link-layer acknowledged by\
       node b.\
\
   3.  after having successfully sent the 6p add request, node a starts\
       a 6p timeout to abort the transaction in the event that no 6p\
       response is received from node b.\
\
   4.  the sf running on node b selects three candidate cells and locks\
       them.  node b sends back a 6p response to node a, indicating the\
       three cells it has selected.  the response is link-layer\
       acknowledged by node a.\
\
   5.  after having successfully sent the 6p response, node b starts a\
       6p timeout to abort the transaction in the event that no 6p\
       confirmation is received from node a.\
\
   6.  the sf running on node a selects two cells from the celllist\
       field in the 6p response and locks them.  node a sends back a 6p\
       confirmation to node b, indicating the cells it selected.  the\
       confirmation is link-layer acknowledged by node b.\
\
   7.  upon completion of the 6p transaction, two cells from node a to\
       node b have been added to the tsch schedule of both nodes a\
       and b.\
\
   8.  an inconsistency in the schedule can happen if the 6p timeout\
       expires when the 6p confirmation is in the air, if the last\
       link-layer ack for the 6p confirmation is lost, or if one of the\
       nodes is power-cycled during the transaction.  6p provides an\
       inconsistency detection mechanism to cope with such situations;\
       see section 3.4.6.2 for details.\

\
\
3.2.  message format\
\
3.2.1.  6top information element (ie)\
\
   6p messages travel over a single hop.  6p messages are carried as\
   payload of an 802.15.4 payload information element (ie) [ieee802154].\
   the messages are encapsulated within the payload ie header.  the\
   group id is set to the ietf ie value defined in [rfc8137].  the\
   content is encapsulated by a subtype id, as defined in [rfc8137].\
\
   since 6p messages are carried in ies, ieee bit/byte ordering applies.\
   bits within each field in the "6top ie" subtype are numbered from 0\
   (leftmost and least significant) to k-1 (rightmost and most\
   significant), where the length of the field is k bits.  fields that\
   are longer than a single octet are copied to the packet in the order\
   from the octet containing the lowest-numbered bits to the octet\
   containing the highest-numbered bits (little endian).\
\
   this document defines the 6top ie, a subtype of the ietf ie defined\
   in [rfc8137], with subtype subid_6top.  the subtype content of the\
   6top ie is defined in section 3.2.2.  the length of the 6top ie\
   content is variable.\
\
3.2.2.  generic 6p message format\
\
   all 6p messages follow the generic format shown in figure 6.\

   6p version (version):  the version of 6p.  only version 0 is defined\
         in this document.  future specifications may define subsequent\
         versions of 6p.\
\
   type (t):  the type of message.  the message types are defined in\
         section 6.2.2.\
\
   reserved (r):  reserved bits.  these two bits should be set to zero\
         when sending the message and must be ignored upon reception.\

\
\
   code:  the code field contains a 6p command identifier when the 6p\
         message has a type value of request.  section 6.2.3 lists the\
         6p command identifiers.  the code field contains a 6p return\
         code when the 6p message has a type value of response or\
         confirmation.  section 6.2.4 lists the 6p return codes.  the\
         same return codes are used in both 6p response and 6p\
         confirmation messages.\
\
   6top scheduling function identifier (sfid):  the identifier of the sf\
         to use to handle this message.  the sfid is defined in\
         section 4.1.\
\
   seqnum:  the sequence number associated with the 6p transaction.\
         used to match the 6p request, 6p response, and 6p confirmation\
         of the same 6p transaction.  the value of seqnum must be\
         different for each new 6p request issued to the same neighbor\
         and using the same sf.  the seqnum is also used to ensure\
         consistency between the schedules of the two neighbors.\
         section 3.4.6 details how the seqnum is managed.\
\
   other fields:  the list of other fields and how they are used are\
         detailed in section 3.3.\
\
   6p request, 6p response, and 6p confirmation messages for a given\
   transaction must share the same version, sfid, and seqnum values.\
\
   future versions of the 6p message should maintain the format of the\
   6p version, type, and code fields for backward compatibility.\
\
3.2.3.  6p celloptions\
\
   an 8-bit 6p celloptions bitmap is present in the following 6p\
   requests: add, delete, count, list, and relocate.  the format and\
   meaning of this field may be redefined by the sf; the routine that\
   parses this field is therefore associated with a specific sf.\
\
   o  in the 6p add request, the 6p celloptions bitmap is used to\
      specify what type of cell to add.\
\
   o  in the 6p delete request, the 6p celloptions bitmap is used to\
      specify what type of cell to delete.\
\
   o  in the 6p relocate request, the 6p celloptions bitmap is used to\
      specify what type of cell to relocate.\
\
   o  in the 6p count and list requests, the 6p celloptions bitmap is\
      used as a selector of a particular type of cells.\

\
\
   the content of the 6p celloptions bitmap applies to all elements in\
   the celllist field.  the possible values of the 6p celloptions are as\
   follows:\
\
   o  tx = 1 (resp. 0) refers to mactxtype = true (resp. false) in the\
      maclinktable of 802.15.4 [ieee802154].\
\
   o  rx = 1 (resp. 0) refers to macrxtype = true (resp. false) in the\
      maclinktable of 802.15.4.\
\
   o  s = 1 (resp. 0) refers to macsharedtype = true (resp. false) in\
      the maclinktable of 802.15.4.\
\
   section 6.2.6 provides the format of the 6p celloptions bitmap; this\
   format applies unless redefined by the sf.  figure 7 shows the\
   meaning of the 6p celloptions bitmap for the 6p add, delete, and\
   relocate requests (unless redefined by the sf).  figure 8 shows the\
   meaning of the 6p celloptions bitmap for the 6p count and list\
   requests (unless redefined by the sf).\

   it is composed of a concatenation of zero or more 6p cells as defined\
   in figure 9.  the content of the celloptions field specifies the\
   options associated with all cells in the celllist.  this necessarily\
   means that the same options are associated with all cells in the\
   celllist.\
\
   a 6p cell is a 4-byte field; its default format is:\
\
                          1                   2                   3\

\
      slotoffset: the slot offset of the cell.\
\
      channeloffset: the channel offset of the cell.\
\
   the celllist is an opaque set of bytes, sent unmodified to the sf.\
   the length of the celllist field is implicit and is determined by the\
   ie length field of the payload ie header as defined in 802.15.4.  the\
   sf may redefine the format of the celllist field; the routine that\
   parses this field is therefore associated with a specific sf.\

         of scope for this document.  for example, metadata can specify\
         in which slotframe to add the cells.\
\
   celloptions:  indicates the options to associate with the cells to be\
         added.  if more than one cell is added (numcells > 1), the same\
         options are associated with each one.  this necessarily means\
         that if node a needs to add multiple cells with different\
         options it needs to initiate multiple 6p add transactions.\
\
   numcells:  the number of additional cells node a wants to schedule to\
         node b.\
\
   celllist:  a list of zero or multiple candidate cells.  its length is\
         implicit and is determined by the length field of the payload\
         ie header.\

\
   celllist:  a list of zero or more 6p cells.\
\
   consider the topology in figure 1; in this case, the sf on node a\
   decides to add numcells cells to node b.\
\
   node a's sf selects numcandidate cells from its schedule.  these are\
   cells that are candidates to be scheduled with node b.  the\
   celloptions field specifies the type of these cells.  numcandidate\
   must be greater than or equal to numcells.  how many cells node a\
   selects (numcandidate) and how that selection is done are specified\
   in the sf and are out of scope for this document.  node a sends a 6p\
   add request to node b that contains the celloptions, the value of\
   numcells, and a selection of numcandidate cells in the celllist.  if\
   the numcandidate cells do not fit in a single packet, this operation\
   must be split into multiple independent 6p add requests, each for a\
   subset of the number of cells that eventually need to be added.  in\
   the case of a 3-step transaction, the sf is responsible for ensuring\
   that the returned candidate celllist fits into the 6p response.\
\
   upon receiving the request, node b checks to see whether the\
   celloptions are set to a valid value as noted by figure 7.  if this\
   is not the case, a response with code rc_err is returned.  if the\
   number of cells in the received celllist in node b is smaller than\
   numcells, node b must return a 6p response with the rc_err_celllist\
   code.  otherwise, node b's sf verifies which of the cells in the\
   celllist it can install in node b's schedule, following the specified\
   celloptions field.  how that selection is done is specified in the sf\
   and is out of scope for this document.  the verification can succeed\
   (numcells cells from the celllist can be used), fail (none of the\
   cells from the celllist can be used), or partially succeed (fewer\
   than numcells cells from the celllist can be used).  in all cases,\
   node b must send a 6p response that includes a return code set to\
   rc_success and that specifies the list of cells that were scheduled\
   following the celloptions field.  that list can contain numcells\
   elements (succeed), 0 elements (fail), or between 0 and numcells\
   elements (partially succeed).\

   the behavior for deleting cells is equivalent to that of adding cells\
   except that:\
\
   o  the nodes delete the cells they agree upon rather than adding\
      them.\
\
   o  all cells in the celllist must already be scheduled between the\
      two nodes and must match the celloptions field.  if node a puts\
      cells in its celllist that are not already scheduled between the\
      two nodes and match the celloptions field, node b must reply with\
      a rc_err_celllist return code.\
\
   o  the celllist in a 6p request (2-step transaction) or 6p response\
      (3-step transaction) must be empty, contain exactly numcells\
      cells, or contain more than numcells cells.  the case where the\
      celllist is not empty but contains fewer than numcells cells is\
      not supported; the rc_err_celllist code must be returned when the\
      celllist contains fewer than numcells cells.  if the celllist is\
      empty, the sf on the receiving node must choose numcells cells\
      scheduled to the sender matching the celloptions field and delete\
      them.  if the celllist contains more than numcells cells, the sf\
      on the receiving node chooses exactly numcells cells from the\
      celllist to delete.\

3.3.3.  relocating cells\
\
   cell relocation consists of moving a cell to a different\
   [slotoffset,channeloffset] location in the schedule.  the type field\
   (t) is set to request.  the code field is set to relocate.  figure 14\

   candidate celllist:  a list of numcandidate candidate cells for\

         numcells, or greater than numcells.  its length is determined\
         by the length field of the payload ie header.\
\
   in a 2-step 6p relocate transaction, node a specifies both (1) the\
   cells it needs to relocate and (2) the list of candidate cells to\
   relocate to.  the relocation celllist must contain exactly numcells\
   entries.  the candidate celllist must contain at least numcells\
   entries (numcandidate >= numcells).\
\
   in a 3-step 6p relocate transaction, node a specifies only the cells\
   it needs to relocate -- not the list of candidate cells to relocate\
   to.  the candidate celllist must therefore be empty.\

\
   node a's sf wants to relocate numcells cells.  node a creates a 6p\
   relocate request and indicates the cells it wants to relocate in the\
   relocation celllist.  it also selects numcandidate cells from its\
   schedule as candidate cells to relocate the cells to, and it puts\
   them in the candidate celllist.  the celloptions field specifies the\
   type of the cell(s) to relocate.  numcandidate must be greater than\
   or equal to numcells.  how many cells it selects (numcandidate) and\
   how that selection is done are specified in the sf and are out of\
   scope for this document.  node a sends the 6p relocate request to\
   node b.\
\
   upon receiving the request, node b checks to see if the length of the\
   candidate celllist is greater than or equal to numcells.  node b's sf\
   verifies that all the cells in the relocation celllist are scheduled\
   with node a and are associated with the options specified in the\
   celloptions field.  if either check fails, node b must send a 6p\
   response to node a with return code rc_err_celllist.  if both checks\
   pass, node b's sf verifies which of the cells in the candidate\
   celllist it can install in its schedule.  how that selection is done\
   is specified in the sf and is out of scope for this document.  that\
   verification for the candidate celllist can succeed (numcells cells\
   from the candidate celllist can be used), fail (none of the cells\
   from the candidate celllist can be used), or partially succeed (fewer\
   than numcells cells from the candidate celllist can be used).  in all\
   cases, node b must send a 6p response that includes a return code set\
   to rc_success and that specifies the list of cells that will be\
   rescheduled following the celloptions field.  that list can contain\
   numcells elements (succeed), 0 elements (fail), or between 0 and\
   numcells elements (partially succeed).  if n < numcells cells appear\
   in the celllist, this means that the first n cells in the relocation\
   celllist have been relocated and the remainder have not.\

   upon receiving the response with code rc_success, node a relocates\
   the cells specified in the relocation celllist of its relocate\
   request to the new locations specified in the celllist of the 6p\
   response, in the same order.  if the received return code is\
   rc_err_celllist, the transaction is aborted and no cell is relocated.\
   in the case of a 2-step transaction, node b relocates the selected\

   case of a 3-step transaction, node b relocates the selected cells\

\
   when receiving a list command, node b returns the cells scheduled\
   with a in its schedule that match the celloptions field as specified\
   in section 3.2.3.\
\
   when node b receives a list request, the returned celllist in the 6p\
   response contains between 0 and maxnumcells cells, starting from the\
   specified offset.  node b should include as many cells as will fit in\
   the frame.  if the response contains the last cell, node b must set\
   the code field in the response to rc_eol ("end of list", as per\
   figure 38 in section 6.2.4), indicating to node a that there are no\
   more cells that match the request.  node b must return at least one\
   cell, unless the specified offset is beyond the end of b's cell list\
   in its schedule.  if node b has fewer than offset cells that match\
   the request, node b returns an empty celllist and a code field set\
   to rc_eol.\

   when a 6p clear command is issued from node a to node b, both nodes a\
   and b must remove all the cells scheduled between them.  that is,\
   node a must remove all the cells scheduled with node b, and node b\
   must remove all the cells scheduled with node a.  in a 6p clear\
   command, the seqnum must not be checked.  in particular, even if the\
   request contains a seqnum value that would normally cause node b to\
   detect a schedule inconsistency, the transaction must not be aborted.\
   upon 6p clear completion, the value of seqnum must be reset to 0.\
\
   the return code sent in response to a 6p clear command should be\
   rc_success unless the operation cannot be executed.  when the clear\
   operation cannot be executed, the return code must be set to\
   rc_reset.\

3.3.7.  generic signaling between sfs\
\
   the 6p signal message allows the sf implementations on two neighbor\
   nodes to exchange generic commands.  the payload in a received signal\
   message is an opaque set of bytes passed unmodified to the sf.  the\
   length of the payload is determined by the length field of the\
   payload ie header.  how the generic signal command is used is\
   specified by the sf and is outside the scope of this document.  the\
   type field (t) is set to request.  the code field is set to signal.\

3.4.  protocol functional details\
\
3.4.1.  version checking\
\
   all messages contain a version field.  if multiple protocol versions\
   of 6p have been defined (in future specifications for version values\
   different from 0), a node may implement multiple protocol versions at\
   the same time.  when a node receives a 6p message with a version\
   number it does not implement, the node must reply with a 6p response\
   with a return code field set to rc_err_version.  the format of this\
   6p response message must be compliant with version 0 and must be\

\
\
   supported by all future versions of the protocol.  this ensures that\
   when node b sends a 6p response to node a indicating that it does not\
   implement the 6p version in the 6p request, node a can successfully\
   parse that response.\
\
   when a node supports a version number received in a 6p request\
   message, the version field in the 6p response must be the same as the\
   version field in the corresponding 6p request.  similarly, in a\
   3-step transaction, the version field in the 6p confirmation must\
   match that of the 6p request and 6p response of the same transaction.\
\
3.4.2.  sfid checking\
\
   all messages contain an sfid field.  a node may support multiple sfs\
   at the same time.  when receiving a 6p message with an unsupported\
   sfid, a node must reply with a 6p response with a return code of\
   rc_err_sfid.  the sfid field in the 6p response must be the same as\
   the sfid field in the corresponding 6p request.  in a 3-step\
   transaction, the sfid field in the 6p confirmation must match that of\
   the 6p request and the 6p response of the same transaction.\
\
3.4.3.  concurrent 6p transactions\
\
   only a single 6p transaction at a time in a given direction can take\
   place between two neighbors.  that is, a node must not issue a new 6p\
   request to a given neighbor before the previous 6p transaction it\
   initiated has finished (or possibly timed out).  if a node receives a\
   6p request from a given neighbor before having sent the 6p response\
   to the previous 6p request from that neighbor, it must send back a 6p\
   response with a return code of rc_reset (as per figure 38 in\
   section 6.2.4) and discard this ongoing second transaction.  a node\
   receiving a rc_reset code must abort the second transaction and treat\
   it as though it never happened (i.e., reverting changes to the\
   schedule or seqnum done by this transaction).\
\
   nodes a and b may support having two transactions going on at the\
   same time, one in each direction.  similarly, a node may support\
   concurrent 6p transactions with different neighbors.  in this case,\
   the cells involved in an ongoing 6p transaction must be "locked"\
   until the transaction finishes.  for example, in figure 1, node c can\
   have a different ongoing 6p transaction with nodes b and r.  if a\
   node does not have enough resources to handle concurrent 6p\
   transactions from different neighbors, it must reply with a 6p\
   response with return code rc_err_busy (as per figure 38 in\
   section 6.2.4).  if the requested cells are locked, it must reply to\
   that request with a 6p response with return code rc_err_locked (as\
   per figure 38).  the node receiving rc_err_busy or rc_err_locked may\
   implement a retry mechanism as defined by the sf.\

\
\
3.4.4.  6p timeout\
\
   a timeout occurs when the node that successfully sent a 6p request\
   does not receive the corresponding 6p response within an amount of\
   time specified by the sf.  in a 3-step transaction, a timeout also\
   occurs when a node sending the 6p response does not receive a 6p\
   confirmation.  when a timeout occurs, the transaction must be\
   canceled at the node where the timeout occurs.  the value of the 6p\
   timeout should be greater than the longest possible time it takes to\
   receive the 6p response or confirmation.  the value of the 6p timeout\
   hence depends on the number of cells scheduled between the neighbor\
   nodes, the maximum number of link-layer retransmissions, etc.  the sf\
   must determine the value of the timeout.  the value of the timeout is\
   out of scope for this document.\
\
3.4.5.  aborting a 6p transaction\
\
   if the receiver of a 6p request fails during a 6p transaction and is\
   unable to complete it, it should reply to that request with a 6p\
   response with return code rc_reset.  upon receiving this 6p response,\
   the initiator of the 6p transaction must consider the 6p transaction\
   as having failed.\
\
   similarly, in the case of a 3-step transaction, when the receiver of\
   a 6p response fails during the 6p transaction and is unable to\
   complete it, it must reply to that 6p response with a 6p confirmation\
   with return code rc_reset.  upon receiving this 6p confirmation, the\
   sender of the 6p response must consider the 6p transaction as having\
   failed.\
\
3.4.6.  seqnum management\
\
   the seqnum is the field in the 6top ie header used to match request,\
   response, and confirmation messages for a given transaction.  the\
   seqnum is used to detect and handle duplicate commands\
   (section 3.4.6.1) and inconsistent schedules (section 3.4.6.2).  each\
   node remembers the last used seqnum for each neighbor.  that is, a\
   node stores as many seqnum values as it has neighbors.  in the case\
   of supporting multiple sfs at a time, a seqnum value is maintained\
   per sf and per neighbor.  in the remainder of this section, we\
   describe the use of seqnum between two neighbors; the same happens\
   for each other neighbor, independently.\
\
   when a node resets, or after a clear transaction, it must reset\
   seqnum to 0.  the 6p response and 6p confirmation for a transaction\
   must use the same seqnum value as that in the request.  after every\
   transaction, the seqnum must be incremented by exactly 1.\
\

rfc 8480                   6top protocol (6p)              november 2018\
\
\
   specifically, if node a receives the link-layer acknowledgment for\
   its 6p request, it will increment the seqnum by exactly 1 after the\
   6p transaction ends.  this ensures that, for the next 6p transaction\
   where it sends a 6p request, the 6p request will have a different\
   seqnum.\
\
   similarly, node b increments the seqnum by exactly 1 after having\
   received the link-layer acknowledgment for the 6p response (2-step 6p\
   transaction) or after having sent the link-layer acknowledgment for\
   the 6p confirmation (3-step 6p transaction).\
\
   when node b receives a 6p request from node a with seqnum equal to 0,\
   it checks the stored seqnum for a.  if a is a new neighbor, the\
   stored seqnum in b will be 0.  the transaction can continue.  if the\
   stored seqnum for a in b is different than 0, a potential\
   inconsistency is detected.  in this case, b must return rc_err_seqnum\
   with seqnum=0.  the sf of node a may decide what to do next, as\
   described in section 3.4.6.2.\
\
   the seqnum must be implemented as a lollipop counter: it rolls over\
   from 0xff to 0x01 (not to 0x00).  this is used to detect a neighbor\
   reset.  figure 28 lists the possible values of the seqnum.\

\
3.4.6.1.  detecting and handling duplicate 6p messages\
\
   all 6p commands are link-layer acknowledged.  a duplicate message\
   means that a node receives a second 6p request, response, or\
   confirmation.  this happens when the link-layer acknowledgment is not\
   received and a link-layer retransmission happens.  duplicate messages\
   are normal and unavoidable.\

           figure 30: example out-of-order duplicate 6p message\
\
   a node detects a duplicate 6p message when it has the same seqnum and\
   type as the last frame received from the same neighbor.  when\
   receiving a duplicate 6p message, a node must send a link-layer\
   acknowledgment but must silently ignore the 6p message at 6top.\
\
3.4.6.2.  detecting and handling a schedule inconsistency\
\
   a schedule inconsistency happens when the schedules of nodes a and b\
   are inconsistent -- for example, when node a has a transmit cell to\
   node b, but node b does not have the corresponding receive cell and\
   therefore isn't listening to node a on that cell.  a schedule\
   inconsistency results in loss of connectivity.\
\
   the seqnum field, which is present in each 6p message, is used to\
   detect an inconsistency.  the seqnum field increments by 1 in each\
   message, as detailed in section 3.4.6.  a node computes the expected\

\
   seqnum field for the next 6p transaction.  if a node receives a 6p\
   request with a seqnum value that is not the expected value, it has\
   detected an inconsistency.\
\
   there are two cases in which a schedule inconsistency happens.\
\
   the first case is when a node loses state -- for example, when it is\
   power-cycled (turned off, then on).  in that case, its seqnum value\
   is reset to 0.  since the seqnum is a lollipop counter, its neighbor\
   detects an inconsistency in the next 6p transaction.  this is\
   illustrated in figures 31 and 32.\

   the second case is when the maximum number of link-layer\
   retransmissions is reached on the 6p response of a 2-step transaction\
   (or, equivalently, on a 6p confirmation of a 3-step transaction).\

\
   in both cases, node b detects the inconsistency.\
\
   if the inconsistency is detected during a 6p transaction (figure 31),\
   the node that has detected it must send back a 6p response or 6p\
   confirmation with an error code of rc_err_seqnum.  in this 6p\
   response or 6p confirmation, the seqnum field must be set to the\
   value of the sender of the message (0 in the example in figure 31).\

\
\
   the sf of the node that has detected the inconsistency must define\
   how to handle the inconsistency.  three possible ways to do this are\
   as follows:\
\
   o  issue a 6p clear request to clear the schedule, and then rebuild.\
\
   o  issue a 6p list request to retrieve the schedule.\
\
   o  internally "roll back" the schedule.\
\
   how to handle an inconsistency is out of scope for this document.\
   the sf defines how to handle an inconsistency.\
\
3.4.7.  handling error responses\
\
   a return code marked as yes in the "is error?" column in figure 38\
   (section 6.2.4) indicates an error.  when a node receives a 6p\
   response or 6p confirmation with an error, it must consider the 6p\
   transaction as having failed.  in particular, if this was a response\
   to a 6p add, delete, or relocate request, the node must not add,\
   delete, or relocate any of the cells involved in this 6p transaction.\
   similarly, a node sending a 6p response or a 6p confirmation with an\
   error code must not add, delete, or relocate any cells as part of\
   that 6p transaction.  if a node receives an unrecognized return code,\
   the 6p transaction must be considered as having failed.  in\
   particular, in a 3-step 6p transaction, when receiving a 6p response\
   with a return code that it does not recognize, the requester (node a)\
   must send a 6p confirmation to the responder (node b) with return\
   code rc_err and consider the transaction failed.  upon reception of a\
   6p confirmation with return code rc_err, the responder must consider\
   the transaction failed as well.  defining what to do after an error\
   has occurred is out of scope for this document.  the sf defines what\
   to do after an error has occurred.\
\
3.5.  security\
\
   6p messages must be secured through link-layer security.  this is\
   possible because 6p messages are carried as payload ies.\

\
\
4.  requirements for 6top scheduling function (sf) specifications\
\
4.1.  sf identifier (sfid)\
\
   each sf has a 1-byte identifier.  section 6.2.5 defines the rules for\
   applying for an sfid.\
\
4.2.  requirements for an sf specification\
\
   the specification for an sf\
\
   o  must specify an identifier for that sf.\
\
   o  must specify the rule for a node to decide when to add/delete one\
      or more cells to/on a neighbor.\
\
   o  must specify the rule for a transaction source to select cells to\
      add to the celllist field in the 6p add request.\
\
   o  must specify the rule for a transaction destination to select\
      cells from the celllist to add to its schedule.\
\
   o  must specify a value for the 6p timeout or a rule/equation to\
      calculate it.\
\
   o  must specify the rule for ordering cells.\
\
   o  must specify a meaning for the metadata field in the 6p add\
      request.\
\
   o  must specify the sf behavior of a node when it boots.\
\
   o  must specify how to handle a schedule inconsistency.\
\
   o  must specify what to do after an error has occurred (the node\
      either sent a 6p response with an error code or received one).\
\
   o  must specify the list of statistics to gather.  example statistics\
      include the number of transmitted frames to each neighbor.  if the\
      sf does not require that statistics be gathered, the sf\
      specification must explicitly say so.\
\
   o  should clearly state the application domain the sf is created for.\
\
   o  should contain examples that highlight normal and error scenarios.\
\
   o  should contain a list of current implementations, at least during\
      the internet-draft (i-d) state of the document, per [rfc7942].\

\
\
   o  should contain a performance evaluation of the scheme, possibly\
      through references to external documents.\
\
   o  should define the format of the signal command payload and\
      its use.\
\
   o  may redefine the format of the celllist field.\
\
   o  may redefine the format of the celloptions field.\
\
   o  may redefine the meaning of the celloptions field.\
\
5.  security considerations\
\
   6p messages are carried inside 802.15.4 payload information elements\
   (ies).  those payload ies are encrypted and authenticated at the link\
   layer through ccm* [ccm-star] ("ccm" stands for "cipher block\
   chaining -- message authentication code").  6p benefits from the same\
   level of security as any other payload ie.  6p does not define its\
   own security mechanisms.  in particular, although a key management\
   solution is out of scope for this document, 6p will benefit from the\
   key management solution used in the network.  this is relevant, as\
   security attacks such as forgery and misattribution attacks become\
   more damaging when a single key is shared amongst a group of more\
   than two participants.\
\
   6p does not provide protection against dos attacks.  example attacks\
   include not sending confirmation messages in 3-step transactions and\
   sending incorrectly formatted requests.  these cases should be\
   handled by an appropriate policy, such as rate-limiting or\
   time-limited blacklisting of the attacker after several attempts.\
   the effect on the overall network is mostly localized to the two\
   nodes in question, as communication happens in dedicated cells.\

                           smtp tls reporting\
\
abstract\
\
   a number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels\
   between smtp mail transfer agents (mtas), including starttls, dns-\
   based authentication of named entities (dane) tlsa, and mta strict\
   transport security (mta-sts).  these protocols can fail due to\
   misconfiguration or active attack, leading to undelivered messages or\
   delivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels.  this document\
   describes a reporting mechanism and format by which sending systems\
   can share statistics and specific information about potential\
   failures with recipient domains.  recipient domains can then use this\
   information to both detect potential attacks and diagnose\
   unintentional misconfigurations.\

rfc 8460                   smtp tls reporting             september 2018\
\
\
1.  introduction\
\
   the starttls extension to smtp [rfc3207] allows smtp clients and\
   hosts to establish secure smtp sessions over tls.  the protocol\
   design uses an approach that has come to be known as "opportunistic\
   security" (os) [rfc7435].  this method maintains interoperability\
   with clients that do not support starttls, but it means that any\
   attacker could potentially eavesdrop on a session.  an attacker could\
   perform a downgrade or interception attack by deleting parts of the\
   smtp session (such as the "250 starttls" response) or redirect the\
   entire smtp session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved mx record of\
   the delivery domain).\
\
   because such "downgrade attacks" are not necessarily apparent to the\
   receiving mta, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains\
   to report on failures at multiple stages of the mta-to-mta\
   conversation.\
\
   recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by mta-sts\
   [rfc8461] or dane [rfc6698] to publish additional encryption and\
   authentication requirements; this document defines a mechanism for\
   sending domains that are compatible with mta-sts or dane to share\
   success and failure statistics with recipient domains.\
\
   specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers\
   failures in routing, dns resolution, and starttls negotiation; policy\
   validation errors for both dane [rfc6698] and mta-sts [rfc8461]; and\
   a standard txt record that recipient domains can use to indicate\
   where reports in this format should be sent.  the report can also\
   serve as a heartbeat to indicate that systems are successfully\
   negotiating tls during sessions as expected.\
\
   this document is intended as a companion to the specification for\
   smtp mta-sts [rfc8461] and adds reporting abilities for those\
   implementing dane [rfc7672].\
\
1.1.  terminology\
\
   the key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",\
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "not recommended", "may", and\
   "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   bcp 14 [rfc2119] [rfc8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\

\
\
   we also define the following terms for further use in this document:\
\
   o  mta-sts policy: a mechanism by which administrators can specify\
      the expected tls availability, presented identity, and desired\
      actions for a given email recipient domain.  mta-sts is defined in\
      [rfc8461].\
\
   o  dane policy: a mechanism by which administrators can use dnssec to\
      commit an mta to support starttls and to publish criteria to be\
      used to validate its presented certificates.  dane for smtp is\
      defined in [rfc7672], with the base specification defined in\
      [rfc6698] (and updated by [rfc7671]).\
\
   o  tlsrpt (tls reporting) policy: a policy specifying the endpoint to\
      which sending mtas should deliver reports.\
\
   o  policy domain: the domain against which a tlsrpt, an mta-sts, or a\
      dane policy is defined.  for tlsrpt and mta-sts, this is typically\
      the same as the envelope recipient domain [rfc5321], but when mail\
      is routed to a "smarthost" gateway by local policy, the\
      "smarthost" domain name is used instead.  for dane, the policy\
      domain is the "tlsa base domain" of the receiving smtp server as\
      described in section 2.2.3 of rfc 7672 and section 3 of rfc 6698.\
\
   o  sending mta: the mta initiating the relay of an email message.\
\
   o  aggregate report uri (rua): a comma-separated list of locations\
      where the report is to be submitted.\
\
   o  abnf: augmented backus-naur form, a syntax for formally specifying\
      syntax, defined in [rfc5234] and [rfc7405].\
\
2.  related technologies\
\
   o  this document is intended as a companion to the specification for\
      smtp mta-sts [rfc8461].\
\
   o  smtp tlsrpt defines a mechanism for sending domains that are\
      compatible with mta-sts or dane to share success and failure\
      statistics with recipient domains.  dane is defined in [rfc6698],\
      and mta-sts is defined in [rfc8461].\

\
\
3.  reporting policy\
\
   a domain publishes a record to its dns indicating that it wishes to\
   receive reports.  these smtp tlsrpt policies are distributed via dns\
   from the policy domain's zone as txt records (similar to domain-based\
   message authentication, reporting, and conformance (dmarc) policies)\
   under the name "_smtp._tls".  for example, for the policy domain\
   "example.com", the recipient's tlsrpt policy can be retrieved from\
   "_smtp._tls.example.com".\
\
   policies consist of the following directives:\
\
   o  "v": this document defines version 1 of tlsrpt, for which this\
      value must be equal to "tlsrptv1".  other versions may be defined\
      in later documents.\
\
   o  "rua": a uri specifying the endpoint to which aggregate\
      information about policy validation results should be sent (see\
      section 4, "reporting schema", for more information).  two uri\
      schemes are supported: "mailto" and "https".  as with dmarc\
      [rfc7489], the policy domain can specify a comma-separated list of\
      uris.\
\
   o  in the case of "https", reports should be submitted via post\
      [rfc7231] to the specified uri.  report submitters may ignore\
      certificate validation errors when submitting reports via https\
      post.\
\
   o  in the case of "mailto", reports should be submitted to the\
      specified email address [rfc6068].  when sending failure reports\
      via smtp, sending mtas must deliver reports despite any tls-\
      related failures and should not include this smtp session in the\
      next report.  this may mean that the reports are delivered\
      unencrypted.  reports sent via smtp must contain a valid\
      domainkeys identified mail (dkim) [rfc6376] signature by the\
      reporting domain.  reports lacking such a signature must be\
      ignored by the recipient.  dkim signatures must not use the "l="\
      attribute to limit the body length used in the signature.  this\
      ensures attackers cannot append extraneous or misleading data to a\
      report without breaking the signature.  the dkim txt record should\
      contain the appropriate service type declaration, "s=tlsrpt".  if\
      not present, the receiving system may ignore reports lacking that\
      service type.\
\
   sample dkim record:\
\
      dkim_selector._domainkey.example.com txt\
            "v=dkim1;k=rsa;s=tlsrpt;p=mlf4qwszfase4fa=="\

\
\
   the formal definition of the "_smtp._tls" txt record, defined using\
   [rfc5234] and [rfc7405], is as follows:\
\
        tlsrpt-record     = tlsrpt-version 1*(field-delim tlsrpt-field)\
                            [field-delim]\
\
        field-delim       = *wsp ";" *wsp\
\
        tlsrpt-field      = tlsrpt-rua /        ; note that the\
                            tlsrpt-extension    ; tlsrpt-rua record is\
                                                ; required.\
\
        tlsrpt-version    = %s"v=tlsrptv1"\
\
        tlsrpt-rua        = %s"rua="\
                            tlsrpt-uri *(*wsp "," *wsp tlsrpt-uri)\
\
        tlsrpt-uri        = uri\
                            ; "uri" is imported from [rfc3986];\
                            ; commas (ascii 0x2c), exclamation\
                            ; points (ascii 0x21), and semicolons\
                            ; (ascii 0x3b) must be encoded\
\
        tlsrpt-extension  = tlsrpt-ext-name "=" tlsrpt-ext-value\
\
        tlsrpt-ext-name   = (alpha / digit) *31(alpha /\
                            digit / "_" / "-" / ".")\
\
        tlsrpt-ext-value  = 1*(%x21-3a / %x3c / %x3e-7e)\
                            ; chars excluding "=", ";", sp, and control\
                            ; chars\
\
   if multiple txt records for "_smtp._tls" are returned by the\
   resolver, records that do not begin with "v=tlsrptv1;" are discarded.\
   if the number of resulting records is not one, senders must assume\
   the recipient domain does not implement tlsrpt.  if the resulting txt\
   record contains multiple strings (as described in section 3.3 of\
   [rfc7208]), then the record must be treated as if those strings are\
   concatenated without adding spaces.\
\
   the record supports the ability to declare more than one rua, and if\
   there exists more than one, the reporter may attempt to deliver to\
   each of the supported rua destinations.  a receiver may opt to only\
   attempt delivery to one of the endpoints; however, the report should\
   not be considered successfully delivered until one of the endpoints\
   accepts delivery of the report.\

\
   parsers must accept txt records that are syntactically valid (i.e.,\
   valid key/value pairs separated by semicolons) and implement a\
   superset of this specification, in which case unknown fields shall be\
   ignored.\

4.  reporting schema\
\
   the report is composed as a plaintext file encoded in the internet\
   json (i-json) format [rfc7493].\
\
   aggregate reports contain the following fields:\
\
   o  report metadata:\
\
      *  the organization responsible for the report\
\
      *  contact information for one or more responsible parties for the\
         contents of the report\
\
      *  a unique identifier for the report\
\
      *  the reporting date range for the report\
\
   o  policy, consisting of:\
\
      *  one of the following policy types: (1) the mta-sts policy\
         applied (as a string), (2) the dane tlsa record applied (as a\
         string, with each rr entry of the rrset listed and separated by\
         a semicolon), and (3) the literal string "no-policy-found", if\
         neither a dane nor mta-sts policy could be found.\
\
      *  the domain for which the policy is applied\
\
      *  the mx host\

rfc 8460                   smtp tls reporting             september 2018\
\
\
   o  aggregate counts, comprising result type, sending mta ip,\
      receiving mta hostname, session count, and an optional additional\
      information field containing a uri for recipients to review\
      further information on a failure type.\
\
   note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report\
   may contain overlapping "counts" of failure types when a single send\
   attempt encountered multiple errors.  reporters may report multiple\
   applied policies (for example, an mta-sts policy and a dane tlsa\
   record for the same domain and mx).  because of this, even in the\
   case where only a single policy was applied, the "policies" field of\
   the report body must be an array and not a singular value.\
\
   in the case of multiple failure types, the "failure-details" array\
   would contain multiple entries.  each entry would have its own set of\
   information pertaining to that failure type.\
\
4.1.  report time frame\
\
   the report should cover a full day, from 00:00-24:00 utc.  this\
   should allow for easier correlation of failure events.  to avoid\
   unintentionally overloading the system processing the reports, the\
   reports should be delivered after some delay, perhaps several hours.\
\
   as an example, a sending site might want to introduce a random delay\
   of up to four hours:\
\
          func generate_sleep_delay() {\
            min_delay = 1\
            max_delay = 14400\
            rand = random(min_delay, max_delay)\
            return rand\
          }\
\
          func generate_report(policy_domain) {\
            do_rpt_work(policy_domain)\
            send_rpt(policy_domain)\
          }\
\
          func generate_tlsrpt() {\
            sleep(generate_sleep_delay())\
            for policy_domain in list_of_tlsrpt_enabled_domains {\
              generate_report(policy_domain)\
            }\
          }\

\
\
4.2.  delivery summary\
\
4.2.1.  success count\
\
   o  "total-successful-session-count": this indicates that the sending\
      mta was able to successfully negotiate a policy-compliant tls\
      connection and serves to provide a "heartbeat" to receiving\
      domains that signifies reporting is functional and tabulating\
      correctly.  this field contains an aggregate count of successful\
      connections for the reporting system.\
\
4.2.2.  failure count\
\
   o  "total-failure-session-count": this indicates that the sending mta\
      was unable to successfully establish a connection with the\
      receiving platform.  section 4.3, "result types", will elaborate\
      on the failed negotiation attempts.  this field contains an\
      aggregate count of failed connections.\
\
4.3.  result types\
\
   the list of result types will start with the minimal set below and is\
   expected to grow over time based on real-world experience.  the\
   initial set is outlined in sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.4:\
\
4.3.1.  negotiation failures\
\
   o  "starttls-not-supported": this indicates that the recipient mx did\
      not support starttls.\
\
   o  "certificate-host-mismatch": this indicates that the certificate\
      presented did not adhere to the constraints specified in the mta-\
      sts or dane policy, e.g., if the mx hostname does not match any\
      identities listed in the subject alternative name (san) [rfc5280].\
\
   o  "certificate-expired": this indicates that the certificate has\
      expired.\
\
   o  "certificate-not-trusted": this is a label that covers multiple\
      certificate-related failures that include, but are not limited to,\
      errors such as untrusted/unknown certification authorities (cas),\
      certificate name constraints, certificate chain errors, etc.  when\
      using this declaration, the reporting mta should utilize the\
      "failure-reason-code" to provide more information to the receiving\
      entity.\

\
\
   o  "validation-failure": this indicates a general failure for a\
      reason not matching a category above.  when using this\
      declaration, the reporting mta should utilize the "failure-reason-\
      code" to provide more information to the receiving entity.\
\
4.3.2.  policy failures\
\
4.3.2.1.  dane-specific policy failures\
\
   o  "tlsa-invalid": this indicates a validation error in the tlsa\
      record associated with a dane policy.  none of the records in the\
      rrset were found to be valid.\
\
   o  "dnssec-invalid": this indicates that no valid records were\
      returned from the recursive resolver.\
\
   o  "dane-required": this indicates that the sending system is\
      configured to require dane tlsa records for all the mx hosts of\
      the destination domain, but no dnssec-validated tlsa records were\
      present for the mx host that is the subject of the report.\
      mandatory dane for smtp is described in section 6 of [rfc7672].\
      such policies may be created by mutual agreement between two\
      organizations that frequently exchange sensitive content via\
      email.\
\
4.3.2.2.  mta-sts-specific policy failures\
\
   o  "sts-policy-fetch-error": this indicates a failure to retrieve an\
      mta-sts policy, for example, because the policy host is\
      unreachable.\
\
   o  "sts-policy-invalid": this indicates a validation error for the\
      overall mta-sts policy.\
\
   o  "sts-webpki-invalid": this indicates that the mta-sts policy could\
      not be authenticated using pkix validation.\
\
4.3.3.  general failures\
\
   when a negotiation failure cannot be categorized into one of the\
   "negotiation failures" stated above, the reporter should use the\
   "validation-failure" category.  as tls grows and becomes more\
   complex, new mechanisms may not be easily categorized.  this allows\
   for a generic feedback category.  when this category is used, the\
   reporter should also use "failure-reason-code" to give some feedback\
   to the receiving entity.  this is intended to be a short text field,\
   and the contents of the field should be an error code or error text,\
   such as "x509_v_err_unhandled_critical_crl_extension".\

   transient errors due to too-busy networks, tcp timeouts, etc., are\

      for the report.  it is provided as a string formatted according to\
      "addr-spec specification", section 3.4.1 of [rfc5322].\
\
   o  "report-id": a unique identifier for the report.  report authors\
      may use whatever scheme they prefer to generate a unique\
      identifier.  it is provided as a string.\
\
   o  "policy-type": the type of policy that was applied by the sending\
      domain.  presently, the only three valid choices are "tlsa",\
      "sts", and the literal string "no-policy-found".  it is provided\
      as a string.\
\
   o  "policy-string": an encoding of the applied policy as a json array\
      of strings, whether it's a tlsa record ([rfc6698], section 2.3) or\
      an mta-sts policy.  examples follow in the next section.\
\
   o  "domain": the policy domain against which the mta-sts or dane\
      policy is defined.  in the case of internationalized domain names\
      [rfc5891], the domain must consist of the punycode-encoded\
      a-labels [rfc3492] and not the u-labels.\
\
   o  "mx-host-pattern": in the case where "policy-type" is "sts", it's\
      the pattern of mx hostnames from the applied policy.  it is\
      provided as a json array of strings and is interpreted in the same\
      manner as the rules in "mx host validation"; see section 4.1 of\
      [rfc8461].  in the case of internationalized domain names\
      [rfc5891], the domain must consist of the punycode-encoded\
      a-labels [rfc3492] and not the u-labels.\
\
   o  "result-type": a value from section 4.3, "result types", above.\
\
   o  "ip-address": the ip address of the sending mta that attempted the\
      starttls connection.  it is provided as a string representation of\

\
   o  "receiving-mx-helo" (optional): the hello (helo) or extended hello\
      (ehlo) string from the banner announced during the reported\
      session.\
\
   o  "receiving-ip": the destination ip address that was used when\
      creating the outbound session.  it is provided as a string\
      representation of an ipv4 (see below) or ipv6 [rfc5952] address in\
      dot-decimal or colon-hexadecimal notation.\

\
   o  "additional-info-uri" (optional): a uri [rfc3986] that points to\
      additional information around the relevant "result-type".  for\
      example, this uri might host the complete certificate chain\
      presented during an attempted starttls session.\
\
   o  "failure-reason-code": a text field to include a tls-related error\
      code or error message.\
\
   for report purposes, an ipv4 address is defined via the following\
   abnf:\
\
     ipv4address = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet\
     dec-octet     = digit                 ; 0-9\

4.5.  policy samples\
\
   part of the report body includes the policy that is applied when\
   attempting relay to the destination.\
\
   for dane tlsa policies, this is a json array of strings each\
   representing the rdata of a single tlsa resource record as a space-\
   separated list of its four tlsa fields; the fields are in\
   presentation format (defined in [rfc6698], section 2.2) with no\
   internal spaces or grouping parentheses:\
\
       [\
       "3 0 1 1f850a337e6db9c609c522d136a475638cc43e1ed424f8eec8513\

              d747d1d1234"\
       ]\
\
   for mta-sts policies, this is an array of json strings that\
   represents the policy that is declared by the receiving site,\
   including any errors that may be present.  note that where there are\
   multiple "mx" values, they must be listed as separate "mx" elements\
   in the policy array rather than as a single nested "mx" sub-array.\
\
                       [\
                       "version: stsv1",\
                       "mode: testing",\
                       "mx: mx1.example.com",\
                       "mx: mx2.example.com",\
                       "mx: mx.backup-example.com",\
                       "max_age: 604800"\
                       ]\
\
5.  report delivery\
\

\
5.1.  report filename\
\
   the filename is recommended to be constructed using the following\
   abnf:\
\
    filename        = sender "!" policy-domain "!" begin-timestamp\
                      "!" end-timestamp [ "!" unique-id ] "." extension\
\
    unique-id       = 1*(alpha / digit)\
\
    sender          = domain ; from [rfc5321] -- this is used\
                      ; as the domain for the `contact-info`\
                      ; address in the report body.\
                      ; in the case of internationalized domain\
                      ; names [rfc5891], the domain must consist of\
                      ; the punycode-encoded a-labels [rfc3492] and\
                      ; not the u-labels.\
\
    policy-domain   = domain\
                      ; in the case of internationalized domain\
                      ; names [rfc5891], the domain must consist of\
                      ; the punycode-encoded a-labels [rfc3492] and\
                      ; not the u-labels.\
\
    begin-timestamp = 1*digit\
                      ; seconds since 00:00:00 utc january 1, 1970\
                      ; indicating start of the time range contained\
                      ; in the report\
\
    end-timestamp   = 1*digit\
                      ; seconds since 00:00:00 utc january 1, 1970\
                      ; indicating end of the time range contained\
                      ; in the report\
\
    extension       = "json" / "json.gz"\
\
\
   the extension must be "json" for a plain json file or "json.gz" for a\
   json file compressed using gzip.\
\
   "unique-id" allows an optional unique id generated by the sending mta\
   to distinguish among multiple reports generated simultaneously by\
   different sources for the same policy domain.  for example, this is a\
   possible filename for a compressed report to the policy domain\
   "example.net" from the sending mta "mail.sndr.example.com":\
\
   "mail.sndr.example.com!example.net!1470013207!1470186007!001.json.gz"\

\
\
5.2.  compression\
\
   the report should be subjected to gzip [rfc1952] compression for both\
   email and https transport.  declining to apply compression can cause\
   the report to be too large for a receiver to process (a commonly\
   observed receiver limit is ten megabytes); compressing the file\
   increases the chances of acceptance of the report at some\
   computational cost.\
\
5.3.  email transport\
\
   the report may be delivered by email.  to make the reports machine-\
   parsable for the receivers, we define a top-level media type\
   "multipart/report" with a new parameter "report-type="tlsrpt"".\
   inside it, there are two parts: the first part is human readable,\
   typically "text/plain", and the second part is machine readable with\
   a new media type defined called "application/tlsrpt+json".  if\
   compressed, the report should use the media type "application/\
   tlsrpt+gzip".\
\
   in addition, the following two new top-level message header fields\
   are defined:\
\
   "tls-report-domain: receiver-domain"\
\
   "tls-report-submitter: sender-domain"\
\
   the "tls-report-submitter" value must match the value found in the\
   domain [rfc5321] of the "contact-info" from the report body.  these\
   message header fields must be included and should allow for easy\
   searching for all reports submitted by a reporting domain or a\
   particular submitter, for example, in imap [rfc3501]:\
\
   "s search header "tls-report-domain" "example.com""\
\
   it is presumed that the aggregate reporting address will be equipped\
   to process new message header fields and extract mime parts with the\
   prescribed media type and filename, and ignore the rest.  these\
   additional headers should be included in the dkim [rfc6376] signature\
   for the message.\

\
\
   the rfc5322.subject field for report submissions should conform to\
   the following abnf:\
\
       tlsrpt-subject = %s"report" fws               ; "report"\
                        %s"domain:" fws              ; "domain:"\
                        domain-name fws              ; per [rfc6376]\
                        %s"submitter:" fws           ; "submitter:"\
                        domain-name fws              ; per [rfc6376]\
                        %s"report-id:" fws           ; "report-id:\
                        "<" id-left "@" id-right ">" ; per [rfc5322]\
                        [cfws]                       ; per [rfc5322]\
                                                     ; (as with fws)\
\
   the first domain-name indicates the dns domain name about which the\
   report was generated.  the second domain-name indicates the dns\
   domain name representing the sending mta generating the report.  the\
   purpose of the "report-id:" portion of the field is to enable the\
   policy domain to identify and ignore duplicate reports that might be\
   sent by a sending mta.\
\
   for instance, this is a possible subject field for a report to the\
   policy domain "example.net" from the sending mta\
   "mail.sender.example.com".  it is line-wrapped as allowed by\
   [rfc5322]:\
\
              subject: report domain: example.net\
                  submitter: mail.sender.example.com\

   note that, when sending failure reports via smtp, sending mtas must\

\
5.4.  https transport\
\
   the report may be delivered by post to https.  if compressed, the\
   report should use the media type "application/tlsrpt+gzip"; otherwise\
   it should use the media type "application/tlsrpt+json" (see\
   section 6, "iana considerations").\
\
   the receiving system must return a "successful" response from its\
   https server, typically a 200 or 201 http code [rfc7231].  other\
   codes could indicate a delivery failure and may be retried as per\

\
   local sender policy.  the receiving system is not expected to process\
   reports at receipt time and may store them for processing at a later\
   time.\
\
5.5.  delivery retry\
\
   in the event of a delivery failure, regardless of the delivery\
   method, a sender should attempt redelivery for up to 24 hours after\
   the initial attempt.  as previously stated, the reports are optional,\
   so while it is ideal to attempt redelivery, it is not required.  if\
   multiple retries are attempted, ideally they should be done with\
   exponential backoff.\
\
5.6.  metadata variances\
\
   as stated above, there are a variable number of ways to declare\
   information about the data therein.  if any of the items declared via\
   subject or filename disagree with the report, the report must be\
   considered the authoritative source.\

\
   this document creates a new registry for the "report-type" parameter\
   to the content-type header field for the "multipart/report" top-level\

\
   the registry name is "report type registry", and the procedure for\
   updating the registry will be "specification required" [rfc8126].\
\
   an entry in this registry should contain:\
\
   o  the report-type being registered\
\
   o  one or more registered media types that can be used with this\
      report-type\
\
   o  the document containing the registration action\
\
   o  an optional comment\
\
   the initial entries are:\
\
   report-type: tlsrpt\
   media type: application/tlsrpt+gzip, application/tlsrpt+json\
   registered by: [rfc8460]\
   comment: media types suitable for use with this report-type are\
   defined in sections 6.4 and 6.5 of [rfc8460]\

6.3.  +gzip media type suffix\
\
   this document registers a new media type suffix "+gzip".  the gzip\
   format is a public domain, cross-platform, interoperable file storage\
   and transfer format, specified in [rfc1952]; it supports compression\
   and is used as the underlying representation by a variety of file\
   formats.  the media type "application/gzip" has been registered for\
   such files.  the suffix "+gzip" may be used with any media type whose\
   representation follows that established for "application/gzip".  the\
   registration form for the structured syntax suffix for use with media\
   types is as follows:\
\
   type name: gzip file storage and transfer format.\
\
   +suffix: +gzip\
\
   references: [rfc1952] [rfc6713]\
\
   encoding considerations: gzip is a binary encoding.\
\
   fragment identifier considerations: the syntax and semantics of\
   fragment identifiers specified for +gzip should be as specified for\
   "application/gzip".  (at publication of this document, there is no\
   fragment identification syntax defined for "application/gzip".)  the\
   syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a specific "xxx/\
   yyy+gzip" should be processed as follows:\
\
       for cases defined in +gzip, where the fragment identifier\
       resolves per the +gzip rules, process as specified in\
       +gzip.\
\
       for cases defined in +gzip, where the fragment identifier does\
       not resolve per the +gzip rules, process as specified in\
       "xxx/yyy+gzip".\
\
       for cases not defined in +gzip, process as specified in\
       "xxx/yyy+gzip".\
\
   interoperability considerations: n/a\
\
   security considerations: gzip format doesn't provide confidentiality\
   protection.  integrity protection is provided by an adler-32\
   checksum, which is not cryptographically strong.  see also the\
   security considerations of [rfc6713].  each individual media type\
   registered with a +gzip suffix can have additional security\
   considerations.  additionally, gzip objects can contain multiple\

\
7.  security considerations\
\
   smtp tls reporting provides visibility into misconfigurations or\
   attempts to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support\
   starttls.  there are several security risks presented by the\
   existence of this reporting channel:\
\
   o  flooding of the aggregate report uri (rua) endpoint: an attacker\
      could flood the endpoint with excessive reporting traffic and\
      prevent the receiving domain from accepting additional reports.\
      this type of denial-of-service attack would limit visibility into\
      starttls failures, leaving the receiving domain blind to an\
      ongoing attack.\
\
   o  untrusted content: an attacker could inject malicious code into\
      the report, exploiting any vulnerabilities in the report-handling\
      systems of the receiving domain.  implementers are advised to take\
      precautions against evaluating the contents of the report.\
\
   o  report snooping: an attacker could create a bogus tlsrpt record to\
      receive statistics about a domain the attacker does not own.\
      since an attacker that is able to poison dns is already able to\
      receive counts of smtp connections (and, absent dane or mta-sts\
      policies, actual smtp message payloads), this does not present a\
      significant new vulnerability.\
\
   o  ignoring https validation when submitting reports: when reporting\
      benign misconfigurations, it is likely that a misconfigured smtp\
      server may also mean a misconfigured https server; as a result,\
      reporters who require https validity on the reporting endpoint may\
      fail to alert administrators about such misconfigurations.\
      conversely, in the event of an actual attack, an attacker who\
      wishes to create a gap in reporting and could intercept https\
      reports could, just as easily, simply thwart the resolution of the\
      tlsrpt txt record or establishment of the tcp session to the https\
      endpoint.  furthermore, such a man-in-the-middle attacker could\
      discover most or all of the metadata exposed in a report merely\
      through passive observation.  as a result, we consider the risks\
      of failure to deliver reports on misconfigurations to outweigh\
      those of attackers intercepting reports.\

\
\
   o  reports as ddos: tlsrpt allows specifying destinations for the\
      reports that are outside the authority of the policy domain, which\
      allows domains to delegate processing of reports to a partner\
      organization.  however, an attacker who controls the policy domain\
      dns could also use this mechanism to direct the reports to an\
      unwitting victim, flooding that victim with excessive reports.\
      dmarc [rfc7489] defines a solution for verifying delegation to\
      avoid such attacks; the need for this is greater with dmarc,\
      however, because dmarc allows an attacker to trigger reports to a\
      target from an innocent third party by sending mail to that third\
      party (which triggers a report from the third party to the\
      target).  in the case of tlsrpt, the attacker would have to induce\
      the third party to send mail to the attacker in order to trigger\
      reports from the third party to the victim; this reduces the risk\
      of such an attack and the need for a verification mechanism.\
\
   finally, because tlsrpt is intended to help administrators discover\
   man-in-the-middle attacks against transport-layer encryption,\
   including attacks designed to thwart negotiation of encrypted\
   connections (by downgrading opportunistic encryption or, in the case\
   of mta-sts, preventing discovery of a new mta-sts policy), we must\
   also consider the risk that an adversary who can induce such a\
   downgrade attack can also prevent discovery of the tlsrpt txt record\
   (and thus prevent discovery of the successful downgrade attack).\
   administrators are thus encouraged to deploy tlsrpt txt records with\
   a large ttl (reducing the window for successful application of\
   transient attacks against dns resolution of the record) or to deploy\
   dnssec on the deploying zone.\
\
8.  privacy considerations\
\
   mtas are generally considered public knowledge; however, the\
   internals of how those mtas are configured and the users of those\
   mtas may not be as public.  it should be noted that providing a\
   receiving site with information about tls failures may reveal\
   information about the sender's configuration or even information\
   about the senders themselves.  for example, sending a report may\
   disclose what tls implementation the sender uses, as the inability to\
   negotiate a session may be a known incompatibility between two\
   implementations.  this may, indirectly, leak information on the\
   reporter's operating system or even region, if, for example, a rare\
   tls implementation is popular among certain users or in certain\
   locations.\

abstract\
\
   the internet architecture board (iab) and gsm association (gsma) held\
   a joint workshop on managing radio networks in an encrypted world\
   (marnew), on september 24-25, 2015.  this workshop aimed to discuss\
   solutions for bandwidth optimization on mobile networks for encrypted\
   content, as current solutions rely on unencrypted content, which is\
   not indicative of the security needs of today's internet users.  the\
   workshop gathered ietf attendees, iab members, and participants from\
   various organizations involved in the telecommunications industry\
   including original equipment manufacturers, content providers, and\
   mobile network operators.\
\
   the group discussed internet encryption trends and deployment issues\
   identified within the ietf and the privacy needs of users that should\
   be adhered to.  solutions designed around sharing data from the\
   network to the endpoints and vice versa were then discussed; in\
   addition, issues experienced when using current transport-layer\
   protocols were also discussed.  content providers and content\
   delivery networks (cdns) gave their own views of their experiences\
   delivering their content with mobile network operators.  finally,\
   technical responses to regulation were discussed to help the\
   regulated industries relay the issues of impossible-to-implement or\
   bad-for-privacy technologies back to regulators.\
\
   a group of suggested solutions were devised, which will be discussed\
   in various ietf groups moving forward.\

\
1.  introduction\
\
   the internet architecture board (iab) and gsm association (gsma) held\
   a joint workshop on managing radio networks in an encrypted world\
   (marnew), on september 24-25, 2015.  this workshop aimed to discuss\
   solutions for bandwidth optimization on mobile networks for encrypted\
   content, as current solutions rely on unencrypted content, which is\
   not indicative of the security needs of today's internet users.\
\
   mobile networks have a set of properties that place a large emphasis\
   on sophisticated bandwidth optimization.  the use of encryption is\
   increasing on the internet, which is positive for consumer and\
   business privacy and security.  many existing solutions for mobile\
   bandwidth optimization primarily operate on non-encrypted\
   communications; this can lead to performance issues being amplified\
   on mobile networks.  the use of encryption on networks will continue\
   to increase; with this understanding, the workshop aimed to\
   understand how we can solve the issues of bandwidth optimization and\
   performance on radio networks in this encrypted world.\
\
1.1.  understanding "bandwidth optimization"\
\
   for the purposes of this workshop, bandwidth optimization encompasses\
   a variety of technical topics related to traffic engineering,\
   prioritization, optimization, and efficiency enhancements.  it also\
   encompasses user-related topics such as specific subscription or\
   billing models, and it may touch upon regulatory aspects or other\
   issues relating to government-initiated regulatory concerns.\
\
   the first category of bandwidth optimization includes the following:\
\
   o  caching\
\
   o  prioritization of interactive traffic over background traffic\
\
   o  per-user bandwidth limits\
\
   the second category of bandwidth optimization may depend on one or\
   more of the first category optimization strategies, but may, in\
   particular, also encompass business-related topics such as content\
   delivery arrangements with content providers.\
\
   finally, while not strictly speaking of traffic management, some\
   networks employ policy-based filtering (e.g., requested parental\
   controls), and many networks support some form of legal interception\
   functionality per applicable laws.\

\
\
   many of these functions can continue as they are performed today,\
   even with increased use of encryption.  others are using methods that\
   inspect parts of the communication that are not encrypted today, but\
   will be encrypted, and these functions will have to be done\
   differently in an increasingly encrypted internet.\
\
1.2.  topics\
\
   the workshop aimed to answer questions that focused on:\
\
   o  understanding the bandwidth optimization use cases particular to\
      radio networks;\
\
   o  understanding existing approaches and how these do not work with\
      encrypted traffic;\
\
   o  understanding reasons why the internet has not standardized\
      support for lawful intercept and why mobile networks have;\
\
   o  determining how to match traffic types with bandwidth optimization\
      methods\
\
   o  discussing minimal information to be shared to manage networks but\
      ensure user security and privacy;\
\
   o  developing new bandwidth optimization techniques and protocols\
      within these new constraints;\
\
   o  discussing the appropriate network layer(s) for each management\
      function; and\
\
   o  cooperative methods of bandwidth optimization and issues\
      associated with these.\
\
   the further aim was to gather architectural and engineering guidance\
   on future work in the bandwidth optimization area based on the\
   discussions around the proposed approaches.  the workshop also\
   explored possible areas for standardization, e.g., new protocols that\
   can aid bandwidth optimization whilst ensuring that user security is\
   in line with new work in transport-layer protocols.\
\
1.3.  organization of this report\
\
   this workshop report summarizes the contributions to and discussions\
   at the workshop, organized by topic.  the workshop began with scene-\
   setting topics that covered the issues around deploying encryption,\
   the increased need for privacy on the internet, and setting a clear\
   understanding that ciphertext should remain unbroken.  later sessions\

\
   focused on key solution areas; these included evolution on the\
   transport layer and sending data up or down the path.  a session on\
   application layers and cdns aimed to highlight both issues and\
   solutions experienced on the application layer.  the workshop ended\
   with a session dedicated to discussing a technical response to\
   regulation with regards to encryption.  the contributing documents\
   identified the issues experienced with encryption on radio networks\
   and suggested solutions.  of the solutions suggested, some focused on\
   transport evolution, some on trusted middleboxes, and others on\
   collaborative data exchange.  solutions were discussed within the\
   sessions.  all accepted position papers and detailed transcripts of\
   discussion are available at [marnew].\
\
   the outcomes of the workshop are discussed in sections 7 and 8; they\
   discuss the progress made since the workshop toward each of the\
   identified work items through the time this document was approved for\
   publication.\

   report readers should be reminded that this workshop did not aim to\
   discuss regulation or legislation, although policy topics were\
   mentioned in discussions from time to time.\
\
1.4.  use of note well and the chatham house rule\
\
   the workshop was conducted under the ietf [note_well] with the\
   exception of the "technical analysis and response to potential\
   regulatory reaction" session, which was conducted under the\
   [chatham_house_rule].\
\
1.5.  ietf and gsma\
\
   the ietf and gsma [gsma] have different working practices, standards,\
   and processes.  ietf is an open organization with community-driven\
   standards, with the key aim of functionality and security for the\
   internet's users, while the gsma is membership based and serves the\
   needs of its membership base, most of whom are mobile network\
   operators.\
\
   unlike ietf, gsma makes few standards.  within the telecommunications\
   industry, standards are set in various divergent groups depending on\
   their purpose.  perhaps of most relevance to the bandwidth\
   optimization topic here is the work of the 3rd generation partnership\
   project (3gpp) [sdo_3gpp], which works on radio network and core\
   network standards.  3gpp members include mobile operators and\
   original equipment manufacturers.\

\
\
   one of the 3gpp standards relevant to this workshop is policy and\
   charging control qos [pcc-qos].  traditionally, mobile networks have\
   managed different applications and services based on the resources\
   available and priorities given; for instance, emergency services have\
   a top priority, data has a lower priority, and voice services are\
   somewhere in-between.  3gpp defined the pcc-qos mechanism to support\
   this functionality, and this depends on unencrypted communications\
   [effectencrypt].\
\
2.  scene-setting sessions\
\
   scene-setting sessions aimed to bring all attendees up to a basic\
   understanding of the problem and the scope of the workshop.\
\
   there were three scene-setting sessions:\
\
   o  section 2.1: scene setting\
\
   o  section 2.2: encryption deployment considerations\
\
   o  section 2.3: awareness of user choice (privacy)\
\
2.1.  scene setting\
\
   the telecommunications industry and internet standards community are\
   extremely different in terms of ethos and practices.  both groups\
   drive technical standards in their domain and build technical\
   solutions with some policy-driven use cases.  these technologies, use\
   cases, and technical implementations are different, and the\
   motivators between the two industries are also diverse.\
\
   to ensure all attendees were aligned with contributing to discussions\
   and driving solutions, this "scene setting" session worked on\
   generating a clear scope with all attendees involved.  in short, it\
   was agreed that 1) ciphertext encrypted by one party and intended to\
   be decrypted by a second party should not be decrypted by a third\
   party in any solution, 2) the radio access network (ran) does\
   experience issues with increased encrypted traffic, 3) the ran issues\
   need to be understood precisely, and 4) the goal is to improve user\
   experience on the internet.  proposing new technical solutions based\
   on presumed future regulation was not in scope.  the full scope is\
   given below.\

\
\
2.1.1.  scope\
\
   the attendees identified and agreed to the scope described here.\
\
   we should do the following:\
\
   o  in discussion, assume that there is no broken crypto; ciphertext\
      is increasingly common; congestion does need to be controlled (as\
      do other transport issues); and network management, including\
      efficient use of resources in ran and elsewhere, has to work;\
\
   o  identify how/why ran is different for transport, and attempt to\
      understand the complexities of ran (i.e., how hard it is to\
      manage) and why those complexities matter;\
\
   o  identify the precise problems caused by increased use of\
      encryption;\
\
   o  identify players (in addition to end users), the resulting\
      tensions, and how ciphertext changes those tensions;\
\
   o  discuss how some solutions will be radically changed by ciphertext\
      (it's ok to talk about that)\
\
   o  assume that the best possible quality of experience for the end\
      user is a goal; and lastly,\
\
   o  for the next two days, aim to analyze the situation and identify\
      specific achievable tasks that could be tackled in the ietf or\
      gsma (or elsewhere) and that improve the internet given the\
      assumptions above.\
\
   we should not delve into the following:\
\
   o  ways of doing interception, legal or not, for the reasons\
      described in [rfc2804]; and,\
\
   o  unpredictable political actions.\
\
2.1.2.  encryption statistics and radio access network differences\
\
   according to then-current statistics, attendees were shown that\
   encrypted content reaches around 50% [state_browser] [state_server].\
   the iab is encouraging all ietf working groups to consider the effect\
   encryption being "on by default" will have on new protocol work.  the\
   ietf is also working on encryption at lower layers.  one recent\

\
\
   example of this work is opportunistic tcp encryption within the tcp\
   increased security [tcpinc] working group.  the aims of these work\
   items are greater security and privacy for end users and their data.\
\
   telecommunications networks often contain middleboxes that operators\
   have previously considered to be trusted, but qualifying trust is\
   difficult and should not be assumed.  some interesting use cases\
   exist with these middleboxes, such as anti-spam and malware\
   detection, but these need to be balanced against their ability to\
   open up cracks in the network for attacks such as pervasive\
   monitoring.\
\
   when operators increase the number of radio access network cells\
   (base stations), this can improve the radio access network quality of\
   service; however, it also adds to radio pollution.  this is one\
   example of the balancing act required when devising radio access\
   network architecture.\
\
2.2.  encryption deployment considerations\
\
   encryption across the internet is on the rise.  however, some\
   organizations and individuals that are mainly driven by commercial\
   perspectives come across a common set of operational issues when\
   deploying encryption.  [rfc8404] explains these network management\
   function impacts, detailing areas around incident monitoring, access\
   control management, and regulation on mobile networks.  the data was\
   collected from various internet players, including system and network\
   administrators across enterprise, governmental organizations, and\
   personal use.  the aim of the document is to gain an understanding of\
   what is needed for technical solutions to these issues while\
   maintaining security and privacy for users.  attendees commented that\
   worthwhile additions would be different business environments (e.g.,\
   cloud environments) and service chaining.  incident monitoring in\
   particular was noted as a difficult issue to solve given the use of\
   urls in today's incident monitoring middleware.\
\
   some of these impacts to mobile networks can be resolved using\
   different methods, and the [network_management] document details\
   these methods.  the document focuses heavily on methods to manage\
   network traffic without breaching user privacy and security.\
\
   by reviewing encryption deployment issues and the alternative methods\
   of network management, marnew attendees were made aware of the issues\
   that affect radio networks, the deployment issues that are solvable\
   and require no further action, and those issues that have not yet\
   been solved but should be addressed within the workshop.\

\
\
2.3.  awareness of user choice (privacy)\
\
   some solutions intended to improve delivery of encrypted content\
   could affect some or all of the privacy benefits that encryption\
   provides.  understanding user needs and desires for privacy is\
   therefore important when designing these solutions.\
\
   from a then-current study [pew2014], 64% of users said concerns over\
   privacy have increased, and 67% of mobile internet users would like\
   to do more to protect their privacy.  the world wide web consortium\
   (w3c) and ietf have both responded to user desires for better privacy\
   by recommending encryption for new protocols and web technologies.\
   within the w3c, new security standards are emerging, and the design\
   principles for html maintain that users are the stakeholders with the\
   highest priority, followed by implementors and other stakeholders,\
   which further enforces the "user first" principle.  users also have\
   certain security expectations from particular contexts and sometimes\
   use new technologies to further protect their privacy, even if those\
   technologies weren't initially developed for that purpose.\
\
   operators may deploy technologies that can either impact user privacy\
   without being aware of those privacy implications or incorrectly\
   assume that the benefits users gain from the new technology outweigh\
   the loss of privacy.  if these technologies are necessary, they\
   should be opt in.\
\
   internet stakeholders should understand the priority of other\
   stakeholders.  users should be considered the first priority.  other\
   stakeholders include implementors, developers, advertisers,\
   operators, and other isps.  some technologies, such as cookie use and\
   javascript injection, have been abused by these parties.  this has\
   caused some developers to encrypt content to circumvent these\
   technologies that are seen as intrusive or bad for user privacy.\
\
   if users and content providers are to opt in to network management\
   services with negative privacy impacts, they should see clear value\
   from using these services and understand the impacts of using these\
   services.  users should also have easy abilities to opt out.  some\
   users will always automatically click through consent requests, so\
   any model relying on explicit consent is flawed for these users.\
   understanding the extent of "auto click-through" may improve\
   decisions about the use of consent requests in the future.  one model\
   (cooperative traffic management) works as an agent of the user; by\
   opting in, metadata can be shared.  issues with this involve trust\
   only being applied at endpoints.\

\
3.  network or transport solution sessions\
\
   network or transport solution sessions discussed proposed solutions\
   for managing encrypted traffic on radio access networks.  most\
   solutions focus on metadata sharing, whether this sharing takes place\
   from the endpoint to the network, from the network to the endpoint,\
   or cooperatively in both directions.  transport-layer protocol\
   evolution could be another approach to solve some of the issues radio\
   access networks experience, which cause them to rely on network\
   management middleboxes.  by removing problems at the transport layer,\
   reliance on expensive and complex middleboxes could decrease.\
\
3.1.  sending data up/down for network management benefits\
\
   collaboration between network elements and endpoints could bring\
   about better content distribution.  a number of suggestions were\
   given; these included the following:\
\
   o  mobile throughput guidance [mtg]: exchanges metadata between\
      network elements and endpoints via tcp options.  it also allows\
      for better understanding of how the transport protocol behaves and\
      further improves the user experience, although additional work on\
      mtg is still required.\
\
   o  session protocol for user datagrams [spud]: a udp-based\
      encapsulation protocol to allow explicit cooperation with\
      middleboxes while using, new encrypted transport protocols.\
\
   o  network status api: an api for operators to share congestion\
      status or the state of a cell before an application starts sending\
      data that could allow applications to change their behavior.\
\
   o  traffic classification: classifying traffic and adding these\
      classifications as metadata for analysis throughout the network.\
      this idea has trust and privacy implications.\
\
   o  congestion exposure [conex]: a mechanism where senders inform the\
      network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on\
      the same flow, in-band at the ip layer.\
\
   o  latency versus bandwidth: a bit that allows the content provider\
      to indicate whether higher bandwidth or lower latency is of\
      greater priority and allows the network to react based on that\
      indication.  where this bit resides in the protocol stack and how\
      it is authenticated would need to be decided.\

\
\
   o  no network management tools: disabling all network management\
      tools from the network and relying only on end-to-end protocols to\
      manage congestion.\
\
   o  flow queue controlled delay (fq-codel) [flowqueue]: a hybrid\
      packet scheduler / active queue management (aqm) [rfc7567]\
      algorithm aiming to reduce bufferbloat and latency.  fq-codel\
      manages packets from multiple flows and reduces the impact of\
      head-of-line blocking from bursty traffic.\
\
   some of these suggestions rely on signaling from network elements to\
   endpoints.  others aim to create "hop-by-hop" solutions, which could\
   be more aligned with how congestion is managed today but with greater\
   privacy implications.\
\
   still others rely on signaling from endpoints to network elements.\
   some of these rely on implicit signaling and others on explicit\
   signaling.  some workshop attendees agreed that relying on\
   applications to explicitly declare the quality of service they\
   require was not a good path forward given the lack of success with\
   this model in the past.\
\
3.1.1.  competition, cooperation, and mobile network complexities\
\
   one of the larger issues in sharing data about the problems\
   encountered with encrypted traffic in wireless networks is the matter\
   of competition; network operators are reluctant to relinquish data\
   about their own networks because it contains information that is\
   valuable to competitors, and application providers wish to protect\
   their users and reveal as little information as possible to the\
   network.  some people think that if middleboxes were authenticated\
   and invoked explicitly, this would be an improvement over current\
   transparent middleboxes that intercept traffic without endpoint\
   consent.  some workshop attendees suggested any exchange of\
   information should be bidirectional in an effort to improve\
   cooperation between the elements.  a robust incentive framework could\
   provide a solution to these issues or at least help mitigate them.\
\
   the radio access network is complex because it must deal with a\
   number of conflicting demands.  base stations reflect this\
   environment, and information within these base stations can be of\
   value to other entities on the path.  some workshop participants\
   thought solutions for managing congestion on radio networks should\
   involve the base station if possible.  for instance, understanding\
   how the radio resource controller and aqm [rfc7567] interact (or\
   don't interact) could provide valuable information for solving\

\
\
   issues.  although many workshop attendees agreed that even though\
   there is a need to understand the base station, not all agreed that\
   the base station should be part of a future solution.\
\
   some suggested solutions were based on network categorization and on\
   providing this information to the protocols or endpoints.  completely\
   categorizing radio networks could be impossible due to their\
   complexity, but categorizing essential network properties could be\
   possible and valuable.\
\
4.  transport layer: issues, optimization, and solutions\
\
   tcp has been the dominant transport protocol since tcp/ip replaced\
   the network control protocol (ncp) on the arpanet in march 1983.  tcp\
   was originally devised to work on a specific network model that did\
   not anticipate the high error rates and highly variable available\
   bandwidth scenarios experienced on modern radio access networks.\
\
   furthermore, new network elements have been introduced (nats and\
   network devices with large buffers creating bufferbloat), and\
   considerable peer-to-peer traffic is competing with traditional\
   client-server traffic.  consequently, the transport layer today has\
   requirements beyond what tcp was designed to meet.  tcp has other\
   issues as well; too many services rely on tcp and only tcp, blocking\
   deployment of new transport protocols like the stream control\
   transmission protocol (sctp) and datagram congestion control protocol\
   (dccp).  this means that true innovation on the transport layer\
   becomes difficult because deployment issues are more complicated than\
   just building a new protocol.\
\
   the ietf is trying to solve these issues through the iab's ip stack\
   evolution program, and the first step in this program is to collect\
   data.  network and content providers can provide data including: the\
   cost of encryption, the advantages of network management tools, the\
   deployment of protocols, and the effects when network management\
   tools are disabled.  for mostly competitive reasons, network\
   operators do not tend to reveal network information and so are\
   unlikely to donate this information freely to the ietf.  the gsma is\
   in a position to try to collect this data and anonymize it before\
   bringing it to ietf, which should alleviate the network operator\
   worries but still provide ietf with some usable data.\
\
   although congestion is only detected when packet loss is encountered\
   and better methods based on detecting congestion would be beneficial,\
   a considerable amount of work has already been done on tcp,\
   especially innovation in bandwidth management and congestion control.\

\
\
   furthermore, although the deficiencies of tcp are often considered\
   key issues in the evolution of the internet protocol stack, the main\
   route to resolve these issues may not be a new tcp, but an evolved\
   stack.  some workshop participants suggested that spud [spud] and\
   information-centric networking (icn) [rfc7476] may help here.  quick\
   udp internet connection [quic] engineers stated that the problems\
   solved by quic are general problems, rather than tcp issues.  this\
   view was not shared by all attendees of the workshop.  moreover, tcp\
   has had some improvements in the last few years, which may mean some\
   of the network lower layers should be investigated to see whether\
   improvements can be made.\
\
5.  application-layer optimization, caching, and cdns\
\
   many discussions on the effects of encrypted traffic on radio access\
   networks happen between implementers and the network operators.  this\
   session aimed to gather the opinions of the content and caching\
   providers regarding their experiences running over mobile networks,\
   the quality of experience their users expect, and the content and\
   caching that providers would like to achieve by working with or using\
   the mobile network.\
\
   content providers explained how even though this workshop cited\
   encrypted data over radio access networks as the main issue, the real\
   issue is network management generally, and all actors (applications\
   providers, networks, and devices) need to work together to overcome\
   these general network management issues.  content providers explained\
   how they assume the mobile networks are standards compliant.  when\
   the network is not standards compliant (e.g., using non-standards-\
   compliant intermediaries), content providers can experience real\
   costs as users contact their support centers to report issues that\
   are difficult to test for and resolve.\
\
   content providers cited other common issues concerning data traffic\
   over mobile networks.  data subscription limits (known as "caps")\
   cause issues for users; users are confused about how data caps work\
   or are unsure how expensive media is and how much data it consumes.\
   developers build products on networks not indicative of the networks\
   their customers are using, and not every organization has the\
   finances to build a caching infrastructure.\
\
   strongly related to content providers, content owners consider cdns\
   to be trusted deliverers of content, and cdns have shown great\
   success in fixed networks.  now that more traffic is moving to mobile\
   networks, there is a need to place caches near the user at the edge\
   of the mobile network.  placing caches at the edge of the mobile\
   network is a solution, but it requires standards developed by content\
   providers and mobile network operators.  the ietf's cdn\

\
\
   interconnection [cdni] working group aims to allow global cdns to\
   interoperate with mobile cdns, but this causes huge issues for the\
   caching of encrypted data between these cdns.  some cdns are\
   experimenting with approaches like "keyless ssl" [keylessssl] to\
   enable safer storage of content without passing private keys to the\
   cdn.  blind caching [blind_caching] is another proposal aimed at\
   caching encrypted content closer to the user and managing the\
   authentication at the original content provider servers.\
\
   at the end of the session, each panelist was asked to identify one\
   key collaborative work item.  work items named were: evolving to\
   cache encrypted content, using one bit for latency / bandwidth trade-\
   off (explained below), better collaboration between the network and\
   application, better metrics to aid troubleshooting and innovation,\
   and indications from the network to allow the application to adapt.\
\
6.  technical analysis and response to potential regulatory reaction\
\
   this session was conducted under the chatham house rule.  the session\
   aimed to discuss regulatory and political issues, but not their worth\
   or need, and to understand the laws that exist and how technologists\
   can properly respond to them.\
\
   mobile networks are regulated; compliance is mandatory and can incur\
   costs on the mobile network operator, while non-compliance can result\
   in service license revocation in some nations.  regulation does vary\
   geographically.  some regulations are court orders and others are\
   self-imposed regulations, for example, "block lists" of websites such\
   as the internet watch foundation [iwf] list.  operators are not\
   expected to decrypt sites, so those encrypted sites will not be\
   blocked because of content.\
\
   parental-control-type filters also exist on the network and are\
   easily bypassed today, vastly limiting their effectiveness.  better\
   solutions would allow for users to easily set these restrictions\
   themselves.  other regulations are also hard to meet, such as user\
   data patterns, or will become harder to collect, such as internet of\
   things (iot) cases.  most attendees agreed that if a government\
   cannot get information it needs (and is legally entitled to have)\
   from network operators, they will approach content providers.  some\
   governments are aware of the impact of encryption and are working\
   with, or trying to work with, content providers.  the iab has\
   concluded that blocking and filtering can be done at the endpoints of\
   the communication.\

\
\
   not all of these regulations apply to the internet, and the internet\
   community is not always aware of their existence.  collectively, the\
   internet community can work with gsma and 3gpp and act together to\
   alleviate the risk imposed by encrypted traffic.  some participants\
   expressed concern that governments might require operators to provide\
   information that they no longer have the ability to provide because\
   previously unencrypted traffic is now being encrypted, and this might\
   expose operators to new liability, but no specific examples were\
   given during the workshop.  a suggestion from some attendees was that\
   if any new technical solutions are necessary, they should easily be\
   "switched off".\
\
   some mobile network operators are producing transparency reports\
   covering regulations including lawful intercept.  operators who have\
   done this already are encouraging others to do the same.\
\
7.  suggested principles and solutions\
\
   based on the talks and discussions throughout the workshop, a set of\
   suggested principles and solutions has been collected.  this is not\
   an exhaustive list, and no attempt was made to come to consensus\
   during the workshop, so there are likely at least some participants\
   who would not agree with any particular principle listed below.  the\
   list is a union of participant thinking, not an intersection.\
\
   o  encrypted traffic: any solution should encourage and support\
      encrypted traffic.\
\
   o  flexibility: radio access network qualities vary vastly, and the\
      network needs of content can differ significantly, so any new\
      solution should be flexible across either the network type,\
      content type, or both.\
\
   o  privacy: new solutions should not introduce new ways for\
      information to be discovered and attributed to individual users.\
\
   o  minimum data only for collaborative work: user data, application\
      data, and network data all need protection, so new solutions\
      should use minimal information to make a working solution.\
\
   a collection of solutions suggested by various participants during\
   the workshop is given below.  inclusion in this list does not imply\
   that other workshop participants agreed.  again, the list is a union\
   of proposed solutions, not an intersection.\
\
   o  evolving tcp or evolution on the transport layer: this could take\
      a number of forms, and some of this work is already underway\
      within the ietf.\

\
\
   o  congestion control: many attendees cited congestion control as a\
      key issue.  further analysis, investigation, and work could be\
      done in this space.\
\
   o  sprout [sprout]: researched at mit, sprout is a transport protocol\
      for applications that desire high throughput and low delay.\
\
   o  pcc [pcc]: performance-oriented congestion control is a new\
      architecture that aims for consistent high performance, even in\
      challenging scenarios.  pcc endpoints observe the connection\
      between their actions and their known performance, which allows\
      them to adapt their actions.\
\
   o  cdns and caches: this suggests that placing caches closer to the\
      edge of the radio network, as close as possible to the mobile\
      user, or making more intelligent cdns, would result in faster\
      content delivery and less strain on the network.\
\
   o  blind caching [blind_caching]: this is a proposal for caching of\
      encrypted content.\
\
   o  cdn improvements: this includes keyless ssl and better cdn\
      placement.\
\
   o  mobile throughput guidance [mtg]: this is a mechanism and protocol\
      elements that allow the cellular network to provide near real-time\
      information on capacity available to the tcp server.\
\
   o  one bit for latency / bandwidth trade-off: this suggests\
      determining whether using a single bit in an unencrypted transport\
      header to distinguish between traffic that the sender prefers to\
      be queued and traffic that the sender would prefer to drop rather\
      than delay provides additional benefits beyond what can be\
      achieved without this signaling.\
\
   o  base station: some suggestions involved using the base station,\
      but this was not defined in detail.  the base station holds the\
      radio resource controller and scheduler, which could provide a\
      place to host solutions, or data from the base station could help\
      in devising new solutions.\
\
   o  identify traffic types via 5-tuple: information from the 5-tuple\
      could provide understanding of the traffic type, and network\
      management appropriate for that traffic type could then be\
      applied.\
\

\
\
   o  heuristics: networks can sometimes identify traffic types by\
      observing characteristics, such as data flow rate, and then apply\
      network management to these identified flows.  this is not\
      recommended, as categorizations can be incorrect.\
\
   o  apis: an api for operators to share congestion status or the state\
      of a cell before an application starts sending data could allow\
      applications to change their behavior.  alternatively, an api\
      could provide the network with information on the data type,\
      allowing appropriate network management for that data type;\
      however, this method exposes privacy issues.\
\
   o  standard approach for the operator to offer services to content\
      providers: mobile network operators could provide caching services\
      or other services for content providers to use for faster and\
      smoother content delivery.\
\
   o  aqm [rfc7567] and ecn [rfc3168] deployments: queuing and\
      congestion management methods have existed for some time in the\
      form of aqm, ecn, and others, which can help the transport and\
      internet protocol layers adapt to congestion faster.\
\
   o  trust model or trust framework: some solutions in this area (e.g.,\
      spud) have a reliance on trust when content providers or the\
      network are being asked to add classifiers to their traffic.\
\
   o  keyless ssl [keylessssl]: this allows content providers to\
      maintain their private keys on a key server and host the content\
      elsewhere (e.g., on a cdn).  this could become standardized in the\
      ietf.  [lurk]\
\
   o  meaningful capacity sharing: this includes the conex [conex] work,\
      which exposes information about congestion to the network nodes.\
\
   o  hop-by-hop: some suggestions offer hop-by-hop methods that allow\
      nodes to adapt flow given the qualities of the networks around\
      them and the congestion they are experiencing.\
\
   o  metrics and metric standards: in order to evolve current protocols\
      to be best suited to today's networks, data is needed about\
      current network conditions, protocol deployments, packet traces,\
      and middlebox behavior.  beyond this, proper testing and debugging\
      on networks could provide great insight for stack evolution.\
\
   o  5g: mobile operator standards bodies are in the process of setting\
      the requirements for 5g.  requirements for network management\
      could be added.\

\
\
   in the workshop, attendees identified other areas where greater\
   understanding could help the standards process.  these were\
   identified as:\
\
   o  greater understanding of the ran within the ietf;\
\
   o  reviews and comments on 3gpp perspective; and,\
\
   o  how to do congestion control in the ran.\
\
7.1.  better collaboration\
\
   throughout the workshop, attendees placed emphasis on the need for\
   better collaboration between the ietf and telecommunications bodies\
   and organizations.  the workshop was one such way to achieve this,\
   but the good work and relationships built in the workshop should\
   continue so the two groups can work on solutions that are better for\
   both technologies and users.\
\
8.  since marnew\
\
   since marnew, a number of activities have taken place in various ietf\
   working groups and in groups external to ietf.  the alternatives to\
   content classification for operator resource deployment (accord) bof\
   was held at ietf 95 in november 2015, which brought the workshop\
   discussion to the wider ietf audiences by providing an account of the\
   discussions that had taken place within the workshop and highlighting\
   key areas to progress on.  key areas to progress on and an update on\
   their current status are as follows:\
\
   o  the collection of usable metrics and data were requested by a\
      number of marnew attendees, especially for use within the irtf\
      measurement and analysis for protocols (map) research group; this\
      data has been difficult to collect due to the closed nature of\
      mobile network operators.\
\
   o  understanding impediments to protocol stack evolution has\
      continued within the iab's ip stack evolution program and\
      throughout transport-related ietf working groups such as the\
      transport area working group (tsvwg).\
\
   o  the mobile throughput guidance document [mtg] has entered into a\
      testing and data collection phase, although further advancements\
      in transport technologies (quic, among others) may have stalled\
      efforts in tcp-related proposals.\

rfc 8462                         marnew                     october 2018\
\
\
   o  work on proposals for caching encrypted content continue, albeit\
      with some security flaws that proponents are working on further\
      proposals to fix.  most often, these are discussed within the ietf\
      httpbis working group.\
\
   o  the path layer udp substrate (plus) bof at ietf 96 in july 2016\
      did not result in the formation of a working group, as attendees\
      expressed concern on the privacy issues associated with the\
      proposed data-sharing possibilities of the shim layer.\
\
   o  the limited use of remote keys (lurk) bof at ietf 96 in july 2016\
      did not result in the formation of a working group because the bof\
      identified more problems with the presumed approach than\
      anticipated.\
\
   the most rewarding output of marnew is perhaps the most intangible.\
   marnew gave two rather divergent industry groups the opportunity to\
   connect and discuss common technologies and issues affecting users\
   and operations.  mobile network providers and key internet engineers\
   and experts have developed a greater collaborative relationship to\
   aid development of further standards that work across networks in a\
   secure manner.\
\
9.  security considerations\
\
   this document is an iab report from a workshop on interactions\
   between network security, especially privacy, and network\
   performance.\
\
   it does not affect the security of the internet, taken on its own.\

rfc 8484              dns queries over https (doh)          october 2018\
\
\
1.  introduction\
\
   this document defines a specific protocol, dns over https (doh), for\
   sending dns [rfc1035] queries and getting dns responses over http\
   [rfc7540] using https [rfc2818] uris (and therefore tls [rfc8446]\
   security for integrity and confidentiality).  each dns query-response\
   pair is mapped into an http exchange.\
\
   the described approach is more than a tunnel over http.  it\
   establishes default media formatting types for requests and responses\
   but uses normal http content negotiation mechanisms for selecting\
   alternatives that endpoints may prefer in anticipation of serving new\
   use cases.  in addition to this media type negotiation, it aligns\
   itself with http features such as caching, redirection, proxying,\
   authentication, and compression.\
\
   the integration with http provides a transport suitable for both\
   existing dns clients and native web applications seeking access to\
   the dns.\
\
   two primary use cases were considered during this protocol's\
   development.  these use cases are preventing on-path devices from\
   interfering with dns operations, and also allowing web applications\
   to access dns information via existing browser apis in a safe way\
   consistent with cross origin resource sharing (cors) [fetch].  no\
   special effort has been taken to enable or prevent application to\
   other use cases.  this document focuses on communication between dns\
   clients (such as operating system stub resolvers) and recursive\
   resolvers.\
\
2.  terminology\
\
   a server that supports this protocol is called a "doh server" to\
   differentiate it from a "dns server" (one that only provides dns\
   service over one or more of the other transport protocols\
   standardized for dns).  similarly, a client that supports this\
   protocol is called a "doh client".\
\
   the key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",\
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "not recommended", "may", and\
   "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   bcp 14 [rfc2119] [rfc8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\

\
\
3.  selection of doh server\
\
   the doh client is configured with a uri template [rfc6570], which\
   describes how to construct the url to use for resolution.\
   configuration, discovery, and updating of the uri template is done\
   out of band from this protocol.  note that configuration might be\
   manual (such as a user typing uri templates in a user interface for\
   "options") or automatic (such as uri templates being supplied in\
   responses from dhcp or similar protocols).  doh servers may support\
   more than one uri template.  this allows the different endpoints to\
   have different properties, such as different authentication\
   requirements or service-level guarantees.\
\
   a doh client uses configuration to select the uri, and thus the doh\
   server, that is to be used for resolution.  [rfc2818] defines how\
   https verifies the doh server's identity.\
\
   a doh client must not use a different uri simply because it was\
   discovered outside of the client's configuration (such as through\
   http/2 server push) or because a server offers an unsolicited\
   response that appears to be a valid answer to a dns query.  this\
   specification does not extend dns resolution privileges to uris that\
   are not recognized by the doh client as configured uris.  such\
   scenarios may create additional operational, tracking, and security\
   hazards that require limitations for safe usage.  a future\
   specification may support this use case.\
\
4.  the http exchange\
\
4.1.  the http request\
\
   a doh client encodes a single dns query into an http request using\
   either the http get or post method and the other requirements of this\
   section.  the doh server defines the uri used by the request through\
   the use of a uri template.\
\
   the uri template defined in this document is processed without any\
   variables when the http method is post.  when the http method is get,\
   the single variable "dns" is defined as the content of the dns\
   request (as described in section 6), encoded with base64url\
   [rfc4648].\
\
   future specifications for new media types for doh must define the\
   variables used for uri template processing with this protocol.\
\
   doh servers must implement both the post and get methods.\

rfc 8484              dns queries over https (doh)          october 2018\
\
\
   when using the post method, the dns query is included as the message\
   body of the http request, and the content-type request header field\
   indicates the media type of the message.  posted requests are\
   generally smaller than their get equivalents.\
\
   using the get method is friendlier to many http cache\
   implementations.\
\
   the doh client should include an http accept request header field to\
   indicate what type of content can be understood in response.\
   irrespective of the value of the accept request header field, the\
   client must be prepared to process "application/dns-message" (as\
   described in section 6) responses but may also process other dns-\
   related media types it receives.\
\
   in order to maximize http cache friendliness, doh clients using media\
   formats that include the id field from the dns message header, such\
   as "application/dns-message", should use a dns id of 0 in every dns\
   request.  http correlates the request and response, thus eliminating\
   the need for the id in a media type such as "application/dns-\
   message".  the use of a varying dns id can cause semantically\
   equivalent dns queries to be cached separately.\
\
   doh clients can use http/2 padding and compression [rfc7540] in the\
   same way that other http/2 clients use (or don't use) them.\
\
4.1.1.  http request examples\
\
   these examples use http/2-style formatting from [rfc7540].\
\
   these examples use a doh service with a uri template of\
   "https://dnsserver.example.net/dns-query{?dns}" to resolve in a\
   records.\
\
   the requests are represented as bodies with media type "application/\
   dns-message".\
\
   the first example request uses get to request "www.example.com".\
\
   :method = get\
   :scheme = https\
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net\
   :path = /dns-query?dns=aaabaaabaaaaaaaaa3d3dwdlegftcgxla2nvbqaaaqab\
   accept = application/dns-message\

rfc 8484              dns queries over https (doh)          october 2018\
\
\
   the same dns query for "www.example.com", using the post method would\
   be:\
\
   :method = post\
   :scheme = https\
   :authority = dnsserver.example.net\
   :path = /dns-query\
   accept = application/dns-message\
   content-type = application/dns-message\
   content-length = 33\
\
   <33 bytes represented by the following hex encoding>\
   00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 03 77 77 77\
   07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65  03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00\
   01\
\
   in this example, the 33 bytes are the dns message in dns wire format\
   [rfc1035], starting with the dns header.\
\
   finally, a get-based query for "a.62characterlabel-makes-base64url-\
   distinct-from-standard-base64.example.com" is shown as an example to\
   emphasize that the encoding alphabet of base64url is different than\
   regular base64 and that padding is omitted.\
\
   the dns query, expressed in dns wire format, is 94 bytes represented\
   by the following:\
\
   00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 01 61 3e 36\

4.2.  the http response\
\
   the only response type defined in this document is "application/dns-\
   message", but it is possible that other response formats will be\
   defined in the future.  a doh server must be able to process\
   "application/dns-message" request messages.\

   different response media types will provide more or less information\
   from a dns response.  for example, one response type might include\
   information from the dns header bytes while another might omit it.\
   the amount and type of information that a media type gives are solely\
   up to the format, which is not defined in this protocol.\
\
   each dns request-response pair is mapped to one http exchange.  the\
   responses may be processed and transported in any order using http's\
   multi-streaming functionality (see section 5 of [rfc7540]).\
\
   section 5.1 discusses the relationship between dns and http response\
   caching.\
\
4.2.1.  handling dns and http errors\
\
   dns response codes indicate either success or failure for the dns\
   query.  a successful http response with a 2xx status code (see\
   section 6.3 of [rfc7231]) is used for any valid dns response,\
   regardless of the dns response code.  for example, a successful 2xx\
   http status code is used even with a dns message whose dns response\
   code indicates failure, such as servfail or nxdomain.\
\
   http responses with non-successful http status codes do not contain\
   replies to the original dns question in the http request.  doh\
   clients need to use the same semantic processing of non-successful\
   http status codes as other http clients.  this might mean that the\
   doh client retries the query with the same doh server, such as if\
   there are authorization failures (http status code 401; see\
   section 3.1 of [rfc7235]).  it could also mean that the doh client\
   retries with a different doh server, such as for unsupported media\
   types (http status code 415; see section 6.5.13 of [rfc7231]), or\
   where the server cannot generate a representation suitable for the\
   client (http status code 406; see section 6.5.6 of [rfc7231]), and so\
   on.\

\
5.  http integration\
\
   this protocol must be used with the https uri scheme [rfc7230].\
\
   sections 8 and 9 discuss additional considerations for the\
   integration with http.\
\
5.1.  cache interaction\
\
   a doh exchange can pass through a hierarchy of caches that include\
   both http- and dns-specific caches.  these caches may exist between\
   the doh server and client, or they may exist on the doh client\
   itself.  http caches are generic by design; that is, they do not\
   understand this protocol.  even if a doh client has modified its\
   cache implementation to be aware of doh semantics, it does not follow\
   that all upstream caches (for example, inline proxies, server-side\
   gateways, and content delivery networks) will be.\
\
   as a result, doh servers need to carefully consider the http caching\
   metadata they send in response to get requests (responses to post\
   requests are not cacheable unless specific response header fields are\
   sent; this is not widely implemented and is not advised for doh).\
\
   in particular, doh servers should assign an explicit http freshness\
   lifetime (see section 4.2 of [rfc7234]) so that the doh client is\
   more likely to use fresh dns data.  this requirement is due to http\
   caches being able to assign their own heuristic freshness (such as\
   that described in section 4.2.2 of [rfc7234]), which would take\
   control of the cache contents out of the hands of the doh server.\
\
\

\
rfc 8484              dns queries over https (doh)          october 2018\
\
\
   the assigned freshness lifetime of a doh http response must be less\
   than or equal to the smallest ttl in the answer section of the dns\
   response.  a freshness lifetime equal to the smallest ttl in the\
   answer section is recommended.  for example, if a http response\
   carries three rrsets with ttls of 30, 600, and 300, the http\
   freshness lifetime should be 30 seconds (which could be specified as\
   "cache-control: max-age=30").  this requirement helps prevent expired\
   rrsets in messages in an http cache from unintentionally being\
   served.\
\
   if the dns response has no records in the answer section, and the dns\
   response has an soa record in the authority section, the response\
   freshness lifetime must not be greater than the minimum field from\
   that soa record (see [rfc2308]).\
\
   the stale-while-revalidate and stale-if-error cache-control\
   directives [rfc5861] could be well suited to a doh implementation\
   when allowed by server policy.  those mechanisms allow a client, at\
   the server's discretion, to reuse an http cache entry that is no\
   longer fresh.  in such a case, the client reuses either all of a\
   cached entry or none of it.\
\
   doh servers also need to consider http caching when generating\
   responses that are not globally valid.  for instance, if a doh server\
   customizes a response based on the client's identity, it would not\
   want to allow global reuse of that response.  this could be\
   accomplished through a variety of http techniques, such as a cache-\
   control max-age of 0, or by using the vary response header field (see\
   section 7.1.4 of [rfc7231]) to establish a secondary cache key (see\
   section 4.1 of [rfc7234]).\
\
   doh clients must account for the age response header field's value\
   [rfc7234] when calculating the dns ttl of a response.  for example,\
   if an rrset is received with a dns ttl of 600, but the age header\
   field indicates that the response has been cached for 250 seconds,\
   the remaining lifetime of the rrset is 350 seconds.  this requirement\
   applies to both doh client http caches and doh client dns caches.\
\
   doh clients can request an uncached copy of a http response by using\
   the "no-cache" request cache-control directive (see section 5.2.1.4\
   of [rfc7234]) and similar controls.  note that some caches might not\
   honor these directives, either due to configuration or interaction\
   with traditional dns caches that do not have such a mechanism.\
\
   http conditional requests [rfc7232] may be of limited value to doh,\
   as revalidation provides only a bandwidth benefit and dns\
   transactions are normally latency bound.  furthermore, the http\
   response header fields that enable revalidation (such as "last-\
\

\
\
   modified" and "etag") are often fairly large when compared to the\
   overall dns response size and have a variable nature that creates\
   constant pressure on the http/2 compression dictionary [rfc7541].\
   other types of dns data, such as zone transfers, may be larger and\
   benefit more from revalidation.\
\
5.2.  http/2\
\
   http/2 [rfc7540] is the minimum recommended version of http for use\
   with doh.\
\
   the messages in classic udp-based dns [rfc1035] are inherently\
   unordered and have low overhead.  a competitive http transport needs\
   to support reordering, parallelism, priority, and header compression\
   to achieve similar performance.  those features were introduced to\
   http in http/2 [rfc7540].  earlier versions of http are capable of\
   conveying the semantic requirements of doh but may result in very\
   poor performance.\
\
5.3.  server push\
\
   before using doh response data for dns resolution, the client must\
   establish that the http request uri can be used for the doh query.\
   for http requests initiated by the doh client, this is implicit in\
   the selection of uri.  for http server push (see section 8.2 of\
   [rfc7540]), extra care must be taken to ensure that the pushed uri is\
   one that the client would have directed the same query to if the\
   client had initiated the request (in addition to the other security\
   checks normally needed for server push).\
\
5.4.  content negotiation\
\
   in order to maximize interoperability, doh clients and doh servers\
   must support the "application/dns-message" media type.  other media\
   types may be used as defined by http content negotiation (see\
   section 3.4 of [rfc7231]).  those media types must be flexible enough\
   to express every dns query that would normally be sent in dns over\
   udp (including queries and responses that use dns extensions, but not\
   those that require multiple responses).\
\
6.  definition of the "application/dns-message" media type\
\
   the data payload for the "application/dns-message" media type is a\
   single message of the dns on-the-wire format defined in section 4.2.1\
   of [rfc1035], which in turn refers to the full wire format defined in\
   section 4.1 of that rfc.\

\
\
   although [rfc1035] says "messages carried by udp are restricted to\
   512 bytes", that was later updated by [rfc6891].  this media type\
   restricts the maximum size of the dns message to 65535 bytes.\
\
   note that the wire format used in this media type is different than\
   the wire format used in [rfc7858] (which uses the format defined in\
   section 4.2.2 of [rfc1035] that includes two length bytes).\
\
   doh clients using this media type may have one or more extension\
   mechanisms for dns (edns) options [rfc6891] in the request.  doh\
   servers using this media type must ignore the value given for the\
   edns udp payload size in dns requests.\
\
   when using the get method, the data payload for this media type must\
   be encoded with base64url [rfc4648] and then provided as a variable\
   named "dns" to the uri template expansion.  padding characters for\
   base64url must not be included.\
\
   when using the post method, the data payload for this media type must\
   not be encoded and is used directly as the http message body.\

8.  privacy considerations\
\
   [rfc7626] discusses dns privacy considerations in both "on the wire"\
   (section 2.4 of [rfc7626]) and "in the server" (section 2.5 of\
   [rfc7626]) contexts.  this is also a useful framing for doh's privacy\
   considerations.\
\
8.1.  on the wire\
\
   doh encrypts dns traffic and requires authentication of the server.\
   this mitigates both passive surveillance [rfc7258] and active attacks\
   that attempt to divert dns traffic to rogue servers (see\
   section 2.5.1 of [rfc7626]).  dns over tls [rfc7858] provides similar\
   protections, while direct udp- and tcp-based transports are\
   vulnerable to this class of attack.  an experimental effort to offer\
   guidance on choosing the padding length can be found in [rfc8467].\
\
   additionally, the use of the https default port 443 and the ability\
   to mix doh traffic with other https traffic on the same connection\
   can deter unprivileged on-path devices from interfering with dns\
   operations and make dns traffic analysis more difficult.\
\
8.2.  in the server\
\
   the dns wire format [rfc1035] contains no client identifiers;\
   however, various transports of dns queries and responses do provide\
   data that can be used to correlate requests.  https presents new\
   considerations for correlation, such as explicit http cookies and\
   implicit fingerprinting of the unique set and ordering of http\
   request header fields.\

\
rfc 8484              dns queries over https (doh)          october 2018\
\
\
   a doh implementation is built on ip, tcp, tls, and http.  each layer\
   contains one or more common features that can be used to correlate\
   queries to the same identity.  dns transports will generally carry\
   the same privacy properties of the layers used to implement them.\
   for example, the properties of ip, tcp, and tls apply to\
   implementations of dns over tls.\
\
   the privacy considerations of using the https layer in doh are\
   incremental to those of dns over tls.  doh is not known to introduce\
   new concerns beyond those associated with https.\
\
   at the ip level, the client address provides obvious correlation\
   information.  this can be mitigated by use of a nat, proxy, vpn, or\
   simple address rotation over time.  it may be aggravated by use of a\
   dns server that can correlate real-time addressing information with\
   other personal identifiers, such as when a dns server and dhcp server\
   are operated by the same entity.\
\
   dns implementations that use one tcp connection for multiple dns\
   requests directly group those requests.  long-lived connections have\
   better performance behaviors than short-lived connections; however,\
   they group more requests, which can expose more information to\
   correlation and consolidation.  tcp-based solutions may also seek\
   performance through the use of tcp fast open [rfc7413].  the cookies\
   used in tcp fast open allow servers to correlate tcp sessions.\
\
   tls-based implementations often achieve better handshake performance\
   through the use of some form of session resumption mechanism, such as\
   section 2.2 of [rfc8446].  session resumption creates trivial\
   mechanisms for a server to correlate tls connections together.\
\
   http's feature set can also be used for identification and tracking\
   in a number of different ways.  for example, authentication request\
   header fields explicitly identify profiles in use, and http cookies\
   are designed as an explicit state-tracking mechanism between the\
   client and serving site and often are used as an authentication\
   mechanism.\
\
   additionally, the user-agent and accept-language request header\
   fields often convey specific information about the client version or\
   locale.  this facilitates content negotiation and operational work-\
   arounds for implementation bugs.  request header fields that control\
   caching can expose state information about a subset of the client's\
   history.  mixing doh requests with other http requests on the same\
   connection also provides an opportunity for richer data correlation.\

\
\
   the doh protocol design allows applications to fully leverage the\
   http ecosystem, including features that are not enumerated here.\
   utilizing the full set of http features enables doh to be more than\
   an http tunnel, but it is at the cost of opening up implementations\
   to the full set of privacy considerations of http.\
\
   implementations of doh clients and servers need to consider the\
   benefit and privacy impact of these features, and their deployment\
   context, when deciding whether or not to enable them.\
   implementations are advised to expose the minimal set of data needed\
   to achieve the desired feature set.\
\
   determining whether or not a doh implementation requires http cookie\
   [rfc6265] support is particularly important because http cookies are\
   the primary state tracking mechanism in http.  http cookies should\
   not be accepted by doh clients unless they are explicitly required by\
   a use case.\
\
9.  security considerations\
\
   running dns over https relies on the security of the underlying http\
   transport.  this mitigates classic amplification attacks for udp-\
   based dns.  implementations utilizing http/2 benefit from the tls\
   profile defined in section 9.2 of [rfc7540].\
\
   session-level encryption has well-known weaknesses with respect to\
   traffic analysis, which might be particularly acute when dealing with\
   dns queries.  http/2 provides further advice about the use of\
   compression (see section 10.6 of [rfc7540]) and padding (see\
   section 10.7 of [rfc7540]).  doh servers can also add dns padding\
   [rfc7830] if the doh client requests it in the dns query.  an\
   experimental effort to offer guidance on choosing the padding length\
   can be found in [rfc8467].\
\
   the https connection provides transport security for the interaction\
   between the doh server and client, but it does not provide the\
   response integrity of dns data provided by dnssec.  dnssec and doh\
   are independent and fully compatible protocols, each solving\
   different problems.  the use of one does not diminish the need nor\
   the usefulness of the other.  it is the choice of a client to either\
   perform full dnssec validation of answers or to trust the doh server\
   to do dnssec validation and inspect the ad (authentic data) bit in\
   the returned message to determine whether an answer was authentic or\
   not.  as noted in section 4.2, different response media types will\
   provide more or less information from a dns response, so this choice\
   may be affected by the response media type.\

rfc 8484              dns queries over https (doh)          october 2018\
\
\
   section 5.1 describes the interaction of this protocol with http\
   caching.  an adversary that can control the cache used by the client\
   can affect that client's view of the dns.  this is no different than\
   the security implications of http caching for other protocols that\
   use http.\
\
   in the absence of dnssec information, a doh server can give a client\
   invalid data in response to a dns query.  section 3 disallows the use\
   of doh dns responses that do not originate from configured servers.\
   this prohibition does not guarantee protection against invalid data,\
   but it does reduce the risk.\
\
10.  operational considerations\
\
   local policy considerations and similar factors mean different dns\
   servers may provide different results to the same query, for\
   instance, in split dns configurations [rfc6950].  it logically\
   follows that the server that is queried can influence the end result.\
   therefore, a client's choice of dns server may affect the responses\
   it gets to its queries.  for example, in the case of dns64 [rfc6147],\
   the choice could affect whether ipv6/ipv4 translation will work at\
   all.\
\
   the https channel used by this specification establishes secure two-\
   party communication between the doh client and the doh server.\
   filtering or inspection systems that rely on unsecured transport of\
   dns will not function in a dns over https environment due to the\
   confidentiality and integrity protection provided by tls.\
\
   some https client implementations perform real time third-party\
   checks of the revocation status of the certificates being used by\
   tls.  if this check is done as part of the doh server connection\
   procedure and the check itself requires dns resolution to connect to\
   the third party, a deadlock can occur.  the use of online certificate\
   status protocol (ocsp) [rfc6960] servers or authority information\
   access (aia) for certificate revocation list (crl) fetching (see\
   section 4.2.2.1 of [rfc5280]) are examples of how this deadlock can\
   happen.  to mitigate the possibility of deadlock, the authentication\
   given doh servers should not rely on dns-based references to external\
   resources in the tls handshake.  for ocsp, the server can bundle the\
   certificate status as part of the handshake using a mechanism\
   appropriate to the version of tls, such as using section 4.4.2.1 of\
   [rfc8446] for tls version 1.3.  aia deadlocks can be avoided by\
   providing intermediate certificates that might otherwise be obtained\
   through additional requests.  note that these deadlocks also need to\
   be considered for servers that a doh server might redirect to.\

rfc 8484              dns queries over https (doh)          october 2018\
\
\
   a doh client may face a similar bootstrapping problem when the http\
   request needs to resolve the hostname portion of the dns uri.  just\
   as the address of a traditional dns nameserver cannot be originally\
   determined from that same server, a doh client cannot use its doh\
   server to initially resolve the server's host name into an address.\
   alternative strategies a client might employ include 1) making the\
   initial resolution part of the configuration, 2) ip-based uris and\
   corresponding ip-based certificates for https, or 3) resolving the\
   dns api server's hostname via traditional dns or another doh server\
   while still authenticating the resulting connection via https.\
\
   http [rfc7230] is a stateless application-level protocol, and\
   therefore doh implementations do not provide stateful ordering\
   guarantees between different requests.  doh cannot be used as a\
   transport for other protocols that require strict ordering.\
\
   a doh server is allowed to answer queries with any valid dns\
   response.  for example, a valid dns response might have the tc\
   (truncation) bit set in the dns header to indicate that the server\
   was not able to retrieve a full answer for the query but is providing\
   the best answer it could get.  a doh server can reply to queries with\
   an http error for queries that it cannot fulfill.  in this same\
   example, a doh server could use an http error instead of a non-error\
   response that has the tc bit set.\
\
   many extensions to dns, using [rfc6891], have been defined over the\
   years.  extensions that are specific to the choice of transport, such\
   as [rfc7828], are not applicable to doh.\

\
\
appendix a.  protocol development\
\
   this appendix describes the requirements used to design doh.  these\
   requirements are listed here to help readers understand the current\
   protocol, not to limit how the protocol might be developed in the\
   future.  this appendix is non-normative.\
\
   the protocol described in this document based its design on the\
   following protocol requirements:\
\
   o  the protocol must use normal http semantics.\
\
   o  the queries and responses must be able to be flexible enough to\
      express every dns query that would normally be sent in dns over\
      udp (including queries and responses that use dns extensions, but\
      not those that require multiple responses).\
\
   o  the protocol must permit the addition of new formats for dns\
      queries and responses.\
\
   o  the protocol must ensure interoperability by specifying a single\
      format for requests and responses that is mandatory to implement.\
      that format must be able to support future modifications to the\
      dns protocol including the inclusion of one or more edns options\
      (including those not yet defined).\
\
   o  the protocol must use a secure transport that meets the\
      requirements for https.\
\
   the following were considered non-requirements:\
\
   o  supporting network-specific dns64 [rfc6147]\
\
   o  supporting other network-specific inferences from plaintext dns\
      queries\
\
   o  supporting insecure http\
\
appendix b.  previous work on dns over http or in other formats\
\
   the following is an incomplete list of earlier work that related to\
   dns over http/1 or representing dns data in other formats.\
\
   the list includes links to the tools.ietf.org site (because these\
   documents are all expired) and web sites of software.\

\
1.  introduction\
\
   methods for measuring trust in digital identity transactions have\
   historically fallen into two main categories: either all measurements\
   are combined into a single scalar value or trust decisions are\
   calculated locally based on a detailed set of attribute metadata.\
   this document defines a method of conveying trust information that is\
   more expressive than a single value but less complex than\
   comprehensive attribute metadata.\
\
   prior to the third edition [sp-800-63-3] published in 2017, nist\
   special publication 800-63 [sp-800-63-2] used a single scalar\
   measurement of trust called a level of assurance (loa).  an loa can\
   be used to compare different transactions within a system at a coarse\
   level.  for instance, an loa4 transaction is generally considered\
   more trusted (across all measured categories) than an loa2\
   transaction.  the loa for a given transaction is computed by the\
   identity provider (idp) and is consumed by a relying party (rp).\
   since the trust measurement is a simple numeric value, it's trivial\
   for rps to process and compare.  however, since each loa encompasses\
   many different aspects of a transaction, it can't express many real-\
   world situations.  for instance, an anonymous user account might have\
   a very strong credential, such as would be common of a whistle-blower\
   or political dissident.  despite the strong credential, the lack of\
   identity proofing would make any transactions conducted by the\
   account to fall into a low loa.  furthermore, different use cases and\
   domains require subtly different definitions for their loa\
   categories, and one group's loa2 is not equivalent or even comparable\
   to another group's loa2.\
\
   attribute-based access control (abac) systems used by rps may need to\
   know details about a user's attributes, such as how recently the\
   attribute data was verified and by whom.  attribute metadata systems\
   are capable of expressing extremely fine-grained detail about the\
   transaction.  however, this approach requires the idp to collect,\
   store, and transmit all of this attribute data for the rp's\
   consumption.  the rp must process this data, which may be prohibitive\
   for trivial security decisions.\
\
   the vectors of trust (vot) approach proposed in this document seeks a\
   balance between these two alternatives by allowing expression of\
   multiple aspects of an identity transaction (including but not\
   limited to identity proofing, credential strength, credential\
   management, and assertion strength), without requiring full attribute\
   metadata descriptions.  this method of measurement gives more\
   actionable data and expressiveness than an loa, but it is still\
   relatively easy for the rp to process.  it is anticipated that vot\
   can be used alongside more detailed attribute metadata systems, such\

\
   as the one proposed by nisitir 8112 [nistir-8112].  the rp can use\
   the vector value for most basic decisions but be able to query the\
   idp for additional attribute metadata where needed.  furthermore, for\
   rps that do not have a need for the vector's more fine-grained\
   detail, it is anticipated that some trust frameworks will provide a\
   simple mapping between certain sets of vector values to loas.  in\
   such systems, an rp is given a choice of how much detail to request\
   from the idp in order to process a given transaction.\
\
   this document defines a data model for these vectors and an on-the-\
   wire format for conveying them between parties.  the values of the\
   vectors defined by the data model are anchored in a trust definition.\
   this document also provides guidance for defining values for use in\
   conveying this information, including four component categories and\
   guidance on defining values within those categories.  additionally,\
   this document defines a general-purpose set of component values in an\
   appendix (appendix a) for use cases that do not need something more\
   specific.\
\
1.1.  requirements language\
\
   the key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",\
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "not recommended", "may", and\
   "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   bcp 14 [rfc2119] [rfc8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
1.2.  terminology\
\
   identity federation:  a protocol in which an identity provider (idp)\
      asserts a user's identity information to an rp.  through the use\
      of a cryptographic assertion or other verifiable mechanism, or a\
      system implementing such a protocol.  it is also referred to\
      simply as "federation".\
\
   identity provider (idp):  a system that manages identity information\
      and is able to assert this information across the network through\
      an identity api.\
\
   identity subject:  the individual (user) engaging in the identity\
      transaction, that is, being identified by the identity provider to\
      the rp.\
\
   identity proofing:  the process of verifying and validating that a\
      set of identity attributes belongs to a real-world identity\
      subject.\

\
\
   primary credential:  the means used by the identity subject to\
      authenticate to the identity provider.\
\
   federated credential:  the assertion presented by the idp to the rp\
      across the network to authenticate the user.\
\
   relying party (rp):  a system that consumes identity information from\
      an idp for the purposes of authenticating the user.\
\
   trust framework:  a document containing business rules and legal\
      clauses that defines how different parties in an identity\
      transaction may act.\
\
   trustmark:  a url referencing a specific trust framework and its\
      definition of vector components and vector component values.\
\
   trustmark provider:  defines the trust framework referenced by its\
      trustmark and can verify that a given system (such as an identity\
      provider) is both capable of asserting and allowed to assert the\
      vector component values it is claiming.\
\
   vector:  a multi-part data structure, which is used here for\
      conveying information about an authentication transaction.\
\
   vector component:  one of several constituent parts that make up a\
      vector, indicating a category of information.\
\
   vector component value:  one of the values applied to a vector\
      component within a vector.\
\
1.3.  identity model\
\
   this document assumes the following model for identity based on\
   identity federation technologies:\
\
   the identity subject (also known as the user) is associated with an\
   identity provider that acts as a trusted third party on behalf of the\
   user, with regard to an rp by making identity assertions about the\
   user to the rp.\
\
   the real-world individual represented by the identity subject is in\
   possession of a primary credential bound to the identity subject by\
   the identity provider (or an agent thereof) in such a way that the\
   binding between the credential and the real-world user is a\
   representation of the identity proofing process performed by the\
   identity provider (or an agent thereof) to verify the identity of the\

\
\
   real-world individual.  this information is carried across the\
   network as part of an identity assertion presented to the rp during\
   the authentication transaction.\
\
1.4.  component architecture\
\
   the term "vectors of trust" is inspired by the mathematical construct\
   of a vector, which is defined as an item composed of multiple\
   independent values.\
\
   an important goal for this work is to balance the need for simplicity\
   (particularly on the part of the rp) with the need for\
   expressiveness.  as such, this vector construct is designed to be\
   composable and extensible.\
\
   the vector is constructed of orthogonal components, such that no\
   aspect of a component overlaps an aspect of another component, as\
   much as is possible.\
\
2.  component dimension definitions\
\
   this specification defines four orthogonal components: identity\
   proofing, primary credential usage, primary credential management,\
   and assertion presentation.\
\
   this specification also defines values for each of these components\
   to be used in the absence of a more specific trust framework in\
   appendix a.  it is expected that trust frameworks will provide\
   context, semantics, and mapping to legal statutes and business rules\
   for each value in each component.\
\
   consequently, a particular vector value can only be compared with\
   vectors defined in the context of a specific trust framework.  the rp\
   must understand and take into account the trust framework context in\
   which a vector is being expressed in order to process a vector\
   correctly.\
\
   each component is identified by a demarcator consisting of a single\
   uppercase ascii letter in the range "[a-z]".  the demarcator should\
   reflect the category with which it is associated in a natural manner.\
   demarcators for components must be registered as described in\
   section 7.  it is anticipated that trust framework definitions will\
   use this registry to define specialized components, but it is\
   recommended that trust frameworks reuse existing components\
   categories wherever possible.  the same demarcator must not be used\
   for two different dimensions, and different trust frameworks should\
   use the same demarcator for similar information.  it is further\
   anticipated that there will be relatively few component dimensions\

\
\
   over time, and this specification defines four general-purpose\
   categories in this section.  note that since the processing for all\
   vector values is contextual to a trust framework, the exact semantics\
   of interpreting a component will vary based on the trust framework in\
   use.\
\
   the value for a given component within a vector of trust is defined\
   by its demarcator character followed by a single digit or lowercase\
   ascii letter in the range "[0-9a-z]".  categories that have a natural\
   ordering should prefer digits, with larger digits indicating stronger\
   assertions than smaller digits.  categories that do not have a\
   natural ordering, or that can have an ambiguous ordering, should\
   prefer letters.  note that while letters could also imply order, they\
   can also more naturally be used mnemonically.  trust frameworks may\
   use any possible values within a category without the need for them\
   to be contiguous.\
\
   categories may use both letters and digits simultaneously.  for\
   example, a category could define "0" as meaning "no statement is\
   made" while using letters such as "a", "b", and "c" for normal values\
   to indicate specific options.  another system could have an ordered\
   base set of digits with additional details provided by letters.\
\
   each component may be repeated with multiple different values within\
   a single vector, representing the logical and of the values (see\
   section 3.1 for details).  the same component and value combination\
   must not be repeated within a single vector.  for example, a vector\
   could contain both "p1" and "pa" but not two instances of "p1".  a\
   trust framework may define additional restrictions on combinations of\
   values.\
\
   regardless of the type of value, the rp must not assume that the\
   values assigned to each component of a vector have inherent ordinal\
   or subsumptive properties when compared to the same or other\
   components in the vector space without specific knowledge of the\
   trust framework in use.  in other words, "1" is always different from\
   "2", but it is dangerous to assume that "2" is always better than "1"\
   or that "2" satisfies all the requirements of "1".\
\
2.1.  identity proofing (p)\
\
   the identity proofing dimension defines, overall, how strongly the\
   set of identity attributes have been verified and vetted.  in other\
   words, this dimension describes how likely it is that a given digital\
   identity transaction corresponds to a particular (real-world)\
   identity subject.  for example, did the user have to provide\
   documentation to a trusted party to prove their legal name and\
   address, or were they able to self-assert such values?\

rfc 8485                    vectors of trust                october 2018\
\
\
   this dimension uses the "p" demarcator, such as "p0", "p1", etc.\
   most definitions of identity proofing will have a natural ordering,\
   as more or less stringent proofing can be applied to an individual\
   being granted an account.  in such cases, it is recommended that a\
   digit be used for this component and that only a single value be\
   allowed to be communicated in a transaction.\
\
2.2.  primary credential usage (c)\
\
   the primary credential usage dimension defines how strongly the\
   primary credential can be verified by the idp.  in other words, how\
   easily that credential could be spoofed or stolen.  for example, did\
   the user log in with a password, a biometric, a cryptographic\
   hardware device, or some combination of the above?\
\
   this dimension uses the "c" demarcator, such as "ca", "cb", etc.\
   most definitions of credential usage will not have an overall natural\
   ordering, as there may be several equivalent classes described within\
   a trust framework.  in such cases, it is recommended that a letter be\
   used for this component and that multiple distinct credential usage\
   factors be allowed to be communicated simultaneously, such as when\
   multi-factor authentication is used.\
\
2.3.  primary credential management (m)\
\
   the primary credential management dimension conveys information about\
   the expected lifecycle of the primary credential in use, including\
   its binding, rotation, and revocation.  in other words, the use and\
   strength of policies, practices, and security controls used in\
   managing the credential at the idp and its binding to the intended\
   individual.  for example, can the user bring their own cryptographic\
   device or is one provided by the idp?\
\
   this dimension uses the "m" demarcator, such as "ma", "mb", etc.\
   most definitions of credential management will not have an overall\
   natural ordering, though there can be preference and comparison\
   between values in some circumstances.  in such cases, it is\
   recommended that a letter be used for this component and that\
   multiple distinct values be allowed to be communicated\
   simultaneously.\
\
2.4.  assertion presentation (a)\
\
   the assertion presentation dimension defines how well the given\
   digital identity can be communicated across the network without\
   information leaking to unintended parties and without spoofing.  in\
   other words, this dimension describes how likely it is that a given\
   digital identity was asserted by a given identity provider for the\

\
\
   identity subject of a given transaction.  while this information is\
   largely already known by the rp as a side effect of processing an\
   identity assertion in a federation protocol, this dimension is still\
   very useful when the rp requests a login (see section 4) and when\
   describing the capabilities of an idp.  this value also allows the rp\
   to detect when an assertion is presented in a manner it was not\
   intended for, as may be the case with an attack.\
\
   this dimension uses the "a" demarcator, such as "aa", "ab", etc.\
   most definitions of assertion presentation will not have an overall\
   natural ordering.  in such cases, it is recommended that a letter be\
   used for this component and that multiple values be allowed to be\
   communicated simultaneously.\
\
3.  communicating vector values to rps\
\
   a vector of trust is designed to be used in the context of an\
   identity and authentication transaction, providing information about\
   the context of a federated credential.  the vector therefore needs to\
   be able to be communicated in the context of the federated credential\
   in a way that is strongly bound to the assertion representing the\
   federated credential.\
\
   this vector has several requirements for use.\
\
   o  all applicable vector components and values need to be combined\
      into a single vector.\
\
   o  the vector can be communicated across the wire unbroken and\
      untransformed.\
\
   o  all vector components need to remain individually available, not\
      "collapsed" into a single value.\
\
   o  the vector needs to be protected in transit.\
\
   o  the vector needs to be cryptographically bound to the assertion\
      that it is describing.\
\
   o  the vector needs to be interpreted in the context of a specific\
      trust framework definition identified by a trustmark url.\
\
   these requirements lead us to defining a simple string-based\
   representation of the vector that can be incorporated within a number\
   of different locations and protocols without further encoding.\

rfc 8485                    vectors of trust                october 2018\
\
\
3.1.  on-the-wire representation\
\
   the vector must be represented as a period-separated ('.') list of\
   vector components.  a vector component type can occur multiple times\
   within a single vector, but a specific value of a vector component\
   cannot occur more than once in a single vector.  that is, while\
   "cc.cd" is a valid vector, "cc.cc" is not.  multiple values for a\
   component are considered a logical and of the values.\
\
   vector component values may appear in any order within a vector, and\
   the rp must consider different orderings of the same vector\
   equivalent during processing.  for example, "p1.cc.cd.aa",\
   "aa.cc.cd.p1", "cd.p1.cc.aa", and "aa.p1.cd.cc" are all considered\
   equivalent to each other.\
\
   possible vector components may be omitted from a vector.  no holding\
   space is left for an omitted vector component.  if a vector component\
   is omitted, the vector is making no claim for that component.  no\
   default values are assumed for a missing component category.\
\
   vector values must be communicated along with a trustmark url (see\
   section 5) to give the components and component values context.  the\
   trustmark must be cryptographically bound to the vector value, such\
   as the two values being carried together in a signed assertion.  a\
   vector value without context is unprocessable, and vectors defined in\
   different contexts are not directly comparable as whole values.\
   different trust frameworks may reuse component definitions (including\
   their values), but processing of such cross-context values is outside\
   the scope of this specification.\
\
   for example, the vector "p1.cc.ab" translates to "pseudonymous, proof\
   of shared key, signed browser-passed verified assertion, and no claim\
   made toward credential management" in the context of this\
   specification's definitions (see appendix a).  a different vector\
   "cb.mc.cd.ac" translates to "known device, full proofing required for\
   credential issuance and rotation, cryptographic proof of possession\
   of a shared key, signed back-channel verified assertion, and no claim\
   made toward identity proofing" in the same context.  since no claim\
   is made here for identity proofing, no specific value can be assumed\
   by the rp.  note that this doesn't mean the user wasn't proofed at\
   all: it's possible that the user was fully proofed to the highest\
   capabilities within the trust framework, but here the idp is not\
   making any specific claim about proofing to the rp, perhaps to\
   protect the user's privacy.\

\
\
3.2.  in openid connect\
\
   in openid connect [openid], the idp must send the vector as a string\
   within the "vot" (vector of trust) claim in the id token.  the\
   trustmark (see section 5) that applies to this vector must be sent as\
   a url in the "vtm" (vector trust mark) claim to provide context to\
   the vector.\
\
   the "vot" and "vtm" claims are interpreted by the rp to apply to the\
   entire identity transaction and not necessarily to any one attribute\
   specifically.\
\
   for example, assume that for the given trustmark, the body of an id\
   token claiming "pseudonymous, proof of shared key, signed back-\
   channel verified token, and no claim made toward credential\
   management" could look like this json object [rfc8259] payload of the\
   id token.\
\
   {\
       "iss": "https://idp.example.com/",\
       "sub": "jondoe1234",\
       "vot": "p1.cc.ac",\
       "vtm": "https://example.org/vot-trust-framework"\
   }\
\
   the body of the id token is signed and optionally encrypted using\
   json object signing and encryption (jose), as per the openid connect\
   specification.  by putting the "vot" and "vtm" values inside the id\
   token, the vector and its context are strongly bound to the federated\
   credential represented by the id token.\
\
   vector values may be returned in a token introspection [rfc7662]\
   response describing the id token or access token issued during an\
   openid connect transaction using the same claims.\
\
4.  requesting vector values\
\
   in some identity protocols, the rp can request that particular vector\
   values be used for a given identity transaction.  an rp can describe\
   the particular vector component values it desires the idp assert for\
   a given identity transaction by using the same syntax as defined in\
   section 3.1.  processing and fulfillment of these requests are in the\
   purview of the idp, and details are outside the scope of this\
   specification.\
\
   future specifications may define alternative ways for an rp to\
   request vector values from an idp.\

\
\
4.1.  in openid connect\
\
   in openid connect [openid], the client may request a partial set of\
   acceptable vot values with the "vtr" (vector of trust) claim request\
   as part of the request object.  the value of this field is a json\
   array of strings [rfc8259], each string identifying an acceptable set\
   of vector components.  the component values within each vector are\
   anded together while the separate vectors are ored together.  for\
   example, a list of vectors in the form '["p1.cb.cc.ab", "ce.ab"]' is\
   stating that either the full set of "p1 and cb and cc and ab"\
   simultaneously or the full set of "ce and ab" simultaneously are\
   acceptable to this rp for this transaction.\
\
   vector request values may omit components, indicating that any value\
   is acceptable for that component category, including omission of that\
   component in the response vector.\
\
   the mechanism by which the idp processes the "vtr" and maps that to\
   the authentication transaction are out of scope of this\
   specification.\
\
5.  trustmarks\
\
   a trustmark is an https url that references a specific set of vector\
   values as defined by a trust framework.  this url must point to a\
   human-readable document that describes what components and values are\
   valid, how they are used together, and what practices the component\
   values represent within the trust framework.  the contents of the\
   trustmark url must be reachable by the operators or implementors of\
   the rp.  the url must be stable over time for a given trust framework\
   to allow rps to process incoming vectors in a consistent fashion.\
   new versions of a trust framework that require different processing\
   rules must use a different trustmark url.\
\
   for example, <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8485> is used as the\
   trustmark to reference the values defined in appendix a.\
\
   the process of a trustmark provider determining the ability of a\
   particular idp to correctly assert values from a given trust\
   framework is outside the scope of this specification.  determining\
   how an rp should apply the values of a given vector to the rp's\
   processing is outside the scope of this specification.\

\
6.  defining new vector values\
\
   vectors of trust is meant to be a flexible and reusable framework for\
   communicating authentication data between networked parties in an\
   identity federation protocol.  however, the exact nature of the\
   information needed depends on the parties requiring the information\
   and the relationship between them.  while this document does define a\
   usable default set of values in appendix a, it is anticipated that\
   many situations will require an extension of this specification for\
   their own use.\
\
   component categories such as those defined in section 2 are intended\
   to be general-purpose and reusable in a variety of trust frameworks.\
   extension specifications should reuse existing category definitions\
   where possible.  extensions may create additional categories where\
   needed by using the registry defined in section 7.  the registry\
   encourages reuse and discovery of existing categories across\
   different trust frameworks.  for example, the "p" category in another\
   framework should be used for identity proofing and related\
   information.\
\
   the values of components such as those defined in appendix a are\
   intended to be contextual to the defining trust document.  while this\
   specification's component values are intended to be general-purpose\
   and extensions may reuse the values and their definitions, trust\
   frameworks must define all allowable values.  as these values are\
   always interpreted in the context of a trustmark, these values are\
   not recorded in a central registry.  consequently, a p1" value from\
   one framework and a "p1" value from another framework could have very\
   different interpretations depending on their contextual trust\
   framework documents, even though in both cases the "p" component is\
   used for identity proofing in some fashion.\
\
   trust frameworks that implement this specification should choose\
   either a numerical ordering or a group category approach to component\
   values as described in section 2, though combinations of both types\
   may be used.  trust frameworks must specify whether multiple values\
   are allowed for each category, and while any component category is\
   generally allowed to have multiple distinct values, a specific\
   definition of a set of values in an extension may limit a given\
   component category to a single value per transaction.  it is\
   recommended that trust frameworks use a "0" value to indicate an\
   empty or null condition for a given category (for example, no\
   proofing being done or no authentication token being used).\
\
   all trust frameworks that extend and implement this specification\
   must be referenced by a unique trustmark url (see section 5) to allow\
   rps to differentiate between different trust frameworks.\

\
7.  iana considerations\
\
   this specification creates one registry and registers several values\
   into existing registries.\
\
7.1.  vector of trust components registry\
\
   this specification establishes the "vectors of trust components"\
   registry.\
\
   component demarcators are registered by the specification required\
   policy documented in [rfc8126].\
\
   criteria that should be applied by the designated experts includes\
   determining whether the proposed registration is distinct enough from\
   existing entries to warrant registration, whether it is likely to be\
   of general applicability, and whether the registration description is\
   clear.  since all vector processing is contextual to a trust\
   framework, component demarcators that do not meet these criteria can\
   still be used in trust frameworks.  the registry contains vector\
   components that are believed to have general applicability that can\
   be used as well.\
\
   registration requests sent to the vot@ietf.org mailing list for\
   review should use an appropriate subject (e.g., "request to register\
   vector of trust component name: example").  the designated expert(s)\
   will provide review within a two-week period and either approve or\
   deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the\
   review list and iana.  denials should include an explanation and, if\
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.\
   iana must only accept registry updates from the designated expert(s)\
   and should direct all requests for registration to the vot@ietf.org\
   mailing list.  if the designated experts do not respond within the\
   designated period, iana should contact the iesg for guidance.\
\
7.1.1.  registration template\
\
   demarcator symbol:\
      an uppercase ascii letter in the range [a-z] representing this\
      component (e.g., "x").\
\
   description:\
      brief description of the component (e.g., "example description").\
\
   change controller:\
      for ietf-stream rfcs, state "iesg".  for other documents, give the\
      name of the responsible party.\

\
\
   specification document(s):\
      reference to the document(s) that specifies the vector component,\
      preferably including a url that can be used to retrieve a copy of\
      the document(s).  an indication of the relevant sections may also\
      be included but is not required.\
\
7.1.2.  initial registry contents\

   o  reference: [rfc8485]\
\
8.  security considerations\
\
   the vector of trust value needs to be cryptographically protected in\
   transit between parties, such as by using tls as described in\
   [bcp195].  the vector of trust value must be associated with a\
   trustmark by the rp processing the vector.  a signed openid connect\
   id token or a similarly signed assertion from another protocol would\
   fulfill this requirement by carrying both the vector value and the\
   trustmark url as claims.\
\
   the vector value is always associated with a trustmark and needs to\
   be interpreted by the rp in the context of the trust framework\
   defined by that trustmark.  different trust frameworks can apply\
   different interpretations to the same component value, much as was\
   the case with loa.  therefore, an rp interpreting a component value\
   in the wrong context could mistakenly accept or reject a request.  in\

\
\
   order to avoid this mistake, rps need to reject vectors that are\
   defined in trust frameworks that they do not understand how to\
   interpret properly.\
\
   the vot framework provides a mechanism for describing and conveying\
   trust information.  it does not define any policies for an idp\
   determining which vector component values apply to a given\
   transaction, nor does it define any policies for applying the values\
   of a vector to an rp's security decision process.  these policies and\
   associated practices are to be agreed upon by the idp and rp, and\
   they should be expressed in detail in an associated human-readable\
   trust framework document available at the trustmark url.\
\
9.  privacy considerations\
\
   by design, vector of trust values contain information about the\
   user's authentication and associations that can be made thereto.\
   therefore, all aspects of a vector of trust contain potentially\
   privacy-sensitive information and must be guarded as such.  even in\
   the absence of specific attributes about a user, knowledge that the\
   user has been highly proofed or issued a strong token could provide\
   more information about the user than was intended.  it is recommended\
   that idps send and rps request only the information necessary for\
   their use case in order to prevent inadvertent information\
   disclosure.\

\
appendix a.  vectors of trust default component value definitions\
\
   the following general-purpose component definitions may be used when\
   a more specific set is unavailable.  this document defines a trust\
   framework for these component values.  the trustmark url of this\
   trust framework is <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8485>.  all\
   normative requirements following in this section apply to this trust\
   framework alone.\
\
   other trust frameworks that extend and implement this specification\
   should define their own component values as described in section 6.\
   where possible, extensions may reuse specific values and definitions\
   as listed here, but those specific values must be relisted.\
\
a.1.  identity proofing\
\
   the identity proofing component of this vector definition represents\
   the level of scrutiny applied to the identity subject during the\
   proofing process.  higher levels are largely subsumptive of lower\
   levels, such that "p2" fulfills requirements for "p1", etc.  multiple\
   distinct values from this category must not be used in a single\
   transaction.\
\
   p0:  no proofing is done, and data is not guaranteed to be persistent\
        across sessions\
\
   p1:  attributes are self-asserted but consistent over time,\
        potentially pseudonymous\
\
   p2:  identity has been proofed either in person or remotely using\
        trusted mechanisms (such as social proofing)\
\
   p3:  there is a binding relationship between the identity provider\
        and the identified party (such as signed/notarized documents and\
        employment records)\

\
\
a.2.  primary credential usage\
\
   the primary credential usage component of this vector definition\
   represents distinct categories of primary credential that may be used\
   together in a single transaction.  multiple distinct values from this\
   category may be used in a single transaction.\
\
   c0:  no credential is used / anonymous public service\
\
   ca:  simple session http cookies (with nothing else)\
\
   cb:  known device, such as those indicated through device posture or\
        device management systems\
\
   cc:  shared secret, such as a username and password combination\
\
   cd:  cryptographic proof of key possession using shared key\
\
   ce:  cryptographic proof of key possession using asymmetric key\
\
   cf:  sealed hardware token / keys stored in a trusted platform module\
\
   cg:  locally verified biometric\
\
a.3.  primary credential management\
\
   the primary credential management component of this vector definition\
   represents distinct categories of management that may be considered\
   separately or together in a single transaction.  many trust framework\
   deployments may use a single value for this component as a baseline\
   for all transactions and thereby omit it.  multiple distinct values\
   from this category may be used in a single transaction.\
\
   ma:  self-asserted primary credentials (user chooses their own\
        credentials and must rotate or revoke them manually) / no\
        additional verification for primary credential issuance or\
        rotation\
\
   mb:  remote issuance and rotation / use of backup recover credentials\
        (such as email verification) / deletion on user request\
\
   mc:  full proofing required for each issuance and rotation /\
        revocation on suspicious activity\

\
a.4.  assertion presentation\
\
   the assertion presentation component of this vector definition\
   represents distinct categories of assertion that are recommended to\
   be used in a subsumptive manner but may be used together.  multiple\
   distinct values from this category may be used in a single\
   transaction.\
\
   aa:  no protection / unsigned bearer identifier (such as an http\
        session cookie in a web browser)\
\
   ab:  signed and verifiable assertion, passed through the user agent\
        (web browser)\

   workshop was to foster a discussion on the different approaches used\
   by companies and standards developing organizations (sdos) to\
   accomplish interoperability at the application layer.  this report\
   summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the standards\
   community.  the views and positions in this report are those of the\
   workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect those of the\
   authors or the internet architecture board (iab), which organized the\
   workshop.  note that this document is a report on the proceedings of\
   the workshop.  the views and positions documented in this report are\
   those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect iab\
   views and positions.\

1.  introduction\
\
   the internet architecture board (iab) holds occasional workshops\
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the\
   internet, and to suggest future directions for the internet\
   architecture.  the investigated topics often require coordinated\
   efforts from many organizations and industry bodies to improve an\
   identified problem.  one of the targets of the workshops is to\
   establish communication between relevant organizations, especially\
   when the topics are out of the scope of the internet engineering task\
   force (ietf).  this long-term planning function of the iab is\
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working\
   groups of the ietf.\
\
   with the expansion of the internet of things (iot), interoperability\
   becomes more and more important.  standards developing organizations\
   (sdos) have done a tremendous amount of work to standardize new\
   protocols and profile existing protocols.\
\
   at the application layer and at the level of solution frameworks,\
   interoperability is not yet mature.  particularly, the work on data\
   formats (in the form of data models and information models) has not\
   seen the same level of consistency throughout sdos.\
\
   one common problem is the lack of an encoding-independent\
   standardization of the information, the so-called information model.\
   another problem is the strong relationship between data formats and\
   the underlying communication architecture, such as a design in remote\
   procedure call (rpc) style or a restful design (where rest refers to\
   representational state transfer).  furthermore, groups develop\
   solutions that are very similar on the surface but differ slightly in\
   their standardized outcome, leading to interoperability problems.\
   finally, some groups favor different encodings for use with various\
   application-layer protocols.\
\
   thus, the iab decided to organize a workshop to reach out to relevant\
   stakeholders to explore the state of the art and identify commonality\
   and gaps [iotsiag] [iotsiws].  in particular, the iab was interested\
   to learn about the following aspects:\
\
   o  what is the state of the art in data and information models?  what\
      should an information model look like?\
\
   o  what is the role of formal languages, such as schema languages, in\
      describing information and data models?\
\
   o  what is the role of metadata, which is attached to data to make it\
      self-describing?\

   o  how can we achieve interoperability when different organizations,\
      companies, and individuals develop extensions?\
\
   o  what is the experience with interworking various data models\
      developed from different groups, or with data models that evolved\
      over time?\

   o  what functionality should online repositories for sharing schemas\
      have?\
\
   o  how can existing data models be mapped against each other to offer\
      interworking?\
\

      groups and organizations so unique that there is no possibility\
      for cooperation?\
\
   o  how can organizations better work together to increase awareness\
      and information sharing?\
\
2.  terminology\
\
   the first roadblock to interoperability at the level of data models\
   is the lack of a common vocabulary to start the discussion.\
   [rfc3444] provides a starting point by separating conceptual models\
   for designers, or "information models", from concrete detailed\
   definitions for implementers, or "data models".  there are concepts\
   that are undefined in that rfc and elsewhere, such as the interaction\
   with the resources of an endpoint, or "interaction model".\
   therefore, the three "main" common models that were identified were:\
\
   information model\
      an information model defines an environment at the highest level\
      of abstraction and expresses the desired functionality.\
      information models can be defined informally (e.g., in prose) or\
      more formally (e.g., unified modeling language (uml), entity-\
      relationship diagrams, etc.).  implementation details are hidden.\
\
   data model\
      a data model defines concrete data representations at a lower\
      level of abstraction, including implementation- and protocol-\
      specific details.  some examples are snmp management information\
      base (mib) modules, world wide web consortium (w3c) thing\
      description (td) things, yang modules, lightweight machine-to-\
      machine (lwm2m) schemas, open connectivity foundation (ocf)\
      schemas, and so on.\

rfc 8477                   iotsi workshop 2016              october 2018\
\
\
   interaction model\
      an interaction model defines how data is accessed and retrieved\
      from the endpoints, being, therefore, tied to the specific\
      communication pattern that the system has (e.g., rest methods,\
      publish/subscribe operations, or rpc calls).\
\
   another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload\
   that some terms have.  the meaning can vary depending on the context\
   in which the term is used.  some examples of such terms are as\
   follows: semantics, models, encoding, serialization format, media\
   types, and encoding types.  due to time constraints, no concrete\
   terminology was agreed upon, but work will continue within each\
   organization to create various terminology documents.  the\
   participants agreed to set up a github repository [iotsigit] for\
   sharing information.\
\
3.  what problems to solve\
\
   the participants agreed that there is not simply a single problem to\
   be solved but rather a range of problems.  during the workshop, the\
   following problems were discussed:\
\
   o  formal languages for documentation purposes\
\
   to simplify review and publication, sdos need formal descriptions of\
   their data and interaction models.  several of them use a tabular\
   representation found in the specification itself but use a formal\
   language as an alternative way of describing objects and resources\
   for formal purposes.  some examples of formal language use are as\
   follows.\
\
   the open mobile alliance (oma), now oma specworks, used an xml schema\
   [lwm2m-schema] to describe their object and resource definitions.\
   the xml files of standardized objects are available for download at\
   [omna].\
\
   the bluetooth special interest group (sig) defined generic attribute\
   profile (gatt) services and characteristics for use with bluetooth\
   smart/low energy.  the services and characteristics are shown in a\
   tabular form on the bluetooth sig website [sig] and are defined as\
   xml instance documents.\
\
   the open connectivity foundation (ocf) uses json schemas to formally\
   define data models and restful api modeling language (raml) to define\
   interaction models.  the standard files are available online at\
   <oneiota.org>.\

rfc 8477                   iotsi workshop 2016              october 2018\
\
\
   the allseen alliance uses alljoyn introspection xml to define data\
   and interaction models in the same formal language, tailored for\
   rpc-style interaction.  the standard files are available online on\
   the allseen alliance website, but both standard and vendor-defined\
   model files can be obtained by directly querying a device for them at\
   runtime.\
\
   the world wide web consortium (w3c) uses the resource description\
   framework (rdf) to define data and interaction models using a format\
   tailored for the web.\
\
   the internet engineering task force (ietf) uses yang to define data\
   and interaction models.  other sdos may use various other formats.\
\
   o  formal languages for code generation\
\
   code-generation tools that use formal data and information modeling\
   languages are needed by developers.  for example, the allseen visual\
   studio plugin [allseen-plugin] offers a wizard to generate code based\
   on the formal description of the data model.  another example of a\
   data modeling language that can be used for code generation is yang.\
   a popular tool to help with code generation of yang modules is pyang\
   [pyang].  an example of a tool that can generate code for multiple\
   ecosystems is opendof [opendof].  use cases discussed for code\
   generation included easing development of server-side device\
   functionality, clients, and compliance tests.\
\
   o  debugging support\
\
   debugging tools are needed that implement generic object browsers,\
   which use standard data models and/or retrieve formal language\
   descriptions from the devices themselves.  as one example, the nrf\
   bluetooth smart sniffer from nordic semiconductor [nrf-sniffer] can\
   be used to display services and characteristics defined by the\
   bluetooth sig.  as another example, alljoyn explorer\
   [alljoynexplorer] can be used to browse and interact with any\
   resource exposed by an alljoyn device, including both standard and\
   vendor-defined data models, by retrieving the formal descriptions\
   from the device at runtime.\
\
   o  translation\
\
   the working assumption is that devices need to have a common data\
   model with a priori knowledge of data types and actions.  however,\
   that would imply that each consortium/organization will try to define\
   their own data model.  that would cause a major interoperability\
\

\
\
   problem, possibly a completely intractable one given the number of\
   variations, extensions, compositions, or versioning changes that will\
   happen for each data model.\
\
   another potential approach is to have a minimal amount of information\
   on the device to allow for a runtime binding to a specific model, the\
   objective being to require as little prior knowledge as possible.\
\
   moreover, gateways, bridges and other similar devices need to\
   dynamically translate (or map) one data model to another one.\
   complexity will increase as there are also multiple protocols and\
   schemas that make interoperability harder to achieve.\
\
   o  runtime discovery\
\
   runtime discovery allows iot devices to exchange metadata about the\
   data, potentially along with the data exchanged itself.  in some\
   cases, the metadata not only describes data but also the interaction\
   model as well.  an example of such an approach has been shown with\
   hypermedia as the engine of application state (hateoas) [hateoas].\
   another example is that all alljoyn devices support such runtime\
   discovery using a protocol mechanism called "introspection", where\
   the metadata is queried from the device itself [allseen].\
\
   there are various models, whether deployed or possible, for such\
   discovery.  the metadata might be extracted from a specification,\
   looked up on a cloud repository (e.g., oneiota for ocf models),\
   looked up via a vendor's site, or obtained from the device itself\
   (such as in the alljoyn case).  the relevant metadata might be\
   obtained from the same place or different pieces might be obtained\
   from different places, such as separately obtaining (a) syntax\
   information, (b) end-user descriptions in a desired language, and (c)\
   developer-specific comments for implementers.\
\
4.  translation\
\
   in an ideal world where organizations and companies cooperate and\
   agree on a single data model standard, there is no need for gateways\
   that translate from one data model to another one.  however, this is\
   far from reality today, and there are many proprietary data models in\
   addition to the already standardized ones.  as a consequence,\
   gateways are needed to translate between data models.  this leads to\
   (n^2)-n combinations, in the worst case.\
\
   there are analogies with gateways back in the 1980s that were used to\
   translate between network layer protocols.  eventually, ip took over,\
   providing the necessary end-to-end interoperability at the network\
   layer.  unfortunately, the introduction of gateways leads to the loss\
\

\
\
   of expressiveness due to the translation between data models.  the\
   functionality of ip was so valuable in the market that advanced\
   features of other networking protocols became less attractive and\
   were not used anymore.\
\
   participants discussed an alternative that they called a "red star",\
   shown in figure 1, where data models are translated to a common data\
   model shown in the middle.  this reduces the number of translations\
   that are needed down to 2n (in the best case).  the problem, of\
   course, is that everyone wants their own data model to be the red\
   star in the center.\

\
   while the workshop itself was not a suitable forum to discuss the\
   design of such translation in detail, several questions were raised:\
\
   o  do we need a "red star" that does everything, or could we design\
      something that offers a more restricted functionality?\
\
   o  how do we handle loss of data and functionality?\

\
\
   o  should data be translated between data models, or should data\
      models themselves be translated?\
\
   o  how can interaction models be translated?  they need to be dealt\
      with in addition to the data models.\
\
   o  many (if not all) data and interaction models have some bizarre\
      functionality that cannot be translated easily.  how can those be\
      handled?\
\
   o  what limitations are we going to accept in these translations?\
\
   the participants also addressed the question of when translation\
   should be done.  two use cases were discussed:\
\
   (a)  design time: a translation between data model descriptions, such\
        as translating a yang module to a raml/json model, can be\
        performed once, during design time.  a single information model\
        might be mapped to a number of different data models.\
\
   (b)  run time: runtime translation of values in two standard data\
        models can only be algorithmically done when the data model on\
        one side is algorithmically derived from the data model on the\
        other side.  this was called a "derived model".  it was\
        discussed that the availability of runtime discovery can aid in\
        semantic translation, such as when a vendor-specific data model\
        on one side of a protocol bridge is resolved and the translator\
        can algorithmically derive the semantically equivalent vendor-\
        specific data model on the other side.  this situation is\
        discussed in [bridgetaxonomy].\
\
   the participants agreed that algorithm translation will generally\
   require custom code whenever one is translating to anything other\
   than a derived model.\
\
   participants concluded that it is typically easier to translate data\
   between systems that follow the same communication architecture.\
\
5.  dealing with change\
\
   a large part of the workshop was dedicated to the evolution of\
   devices and server-side applications.  interactions between devices\
   and services and how their relationship evolves over time is\
   complicated by their respective interaction models.\
\
   the workshop participants discussed various approaches to deal with\
   change.  in the most basic case, a developer might use a description\
   of an api and implement the protocol steps.  sometimes, the data or\

\
\
   information model can be used to generate code stubs.  subsequent\
   changes to an api require changes on the clients to upgrade to the\
   new version, which requires some development of new code to satisfy\
   the needs of the new api.\
\
   these interactions could be made machine understandable in the first\
   place, enabling for changes to happen at runtime.  in that scenario,\
   a machine client could discover the possible interactions with a\
   service, adapting to changes as they occur without specific code\
   being developed to adapt to them.\
\
   the challenge seems to be to code the human-readable specification\
   into a machine-readable format.  machine-readable languages require a\
   shared vocabulary to give meaning to the tags.\
\
   these types of interactions are often based on the rest architectural\
   style.  its principle is that a device or endpoint only needs a\
   single entry point, with a host providing descriptions of the api\
   in-band by means of web links and forms.\
\
   by defining iot-specific relation types, it is possible to drive\
   interactions through links instead of hard-coding uris into a restful\
   client, thus making the system flexible enough for later changes.\
   the definition of the basic hypermedia formats for iot is still a\
   work in progress.  however, some of the existing mechanisms can be\
   reused, such as resource discovery, forms, or links.\
\
6.  iana considerations\
\
   this document has no iana actions.\
\
7.  security considerations\
\
   there were two types of security considerations discussed: use of\
   formal data models for security configuration and security of data\
   and data models in general.\
\
   it was observed that the security assumptions and configuration, or\
   "security model", varies by ecosystem today, making the job of a\
   translator difficult.  for example, there are different types of\
   security principals (e.g., user vs. device vs. application), the use\
   of access control lists (acls) versus capabilities, and what types of\
   policies can be expressed, all vary by ecosystem.  as a result, the\
   security model architecture generally dictates where translation can\
   be done.\

\
\
   one approach discussed was whether two endpoints might be able to use\
   some overlay security model across a translator between two\
   ecosystems, which only works if the two endpoints agree on a common\
   data model for their communication.  another approach discussed was\
   simply having a translator act as a trusted intermediary, which\
   enables the translator to translate between different data models.\
\
   one suggestion discussed was either adding metadata into the formal\
   data model language or having it accompany the data values over the\
   wire, tagging the data with privacy levels.  however, sometimes even\
   the privacy level of information might itself be sensitive.  still,\
   it was observed that being able to dynamically learn security\
   requirements might help provide better uis and translators.\
\
8.  collaboration\
\
   the participants discussed how best to share information among their\
   various organizations.  one discussion was around having joint\
   meetings.  one current challenge reported was that organizations were\
   not aware of when and where each other's meetings were scheduled, and\
   sharing such information could help organizations better collocate\
   meetings.  to facilitate this exchange, the participants agreed to\
   add links to their respective meeting schedules from a common page in\
   the iotsi repository [iotsigit].\
\
   another challenge reported was that organizations did not know how to\
   find each other's published data models, and sharing such information\
   could better facilitate reuse of the same information model.  to\
   facilitate this exchange, the participants discussed whether a common\
   repository might be used by multiple organizations.  the ocf's\
   oneiota repository was discussed as one possibility, but it was\
   reported that its terms of use at the time of the workshop prevented\
   this.  the ocf agreed to take this back and look at updating the\
   terms of use to allow other organizations to use it, as the\
   restriction was not the intent.  <schema.org> was discussed as\
   another possibility.  in the meantime, the participants agreed to add\
   links to their respective repositories from a common page in the\
   iotsi repository [iotsigit].\
\
   it was also agreed that the iotsi@iab.org mailing list would remain\
   open and available for sharing information between all relevant\
   organizations.\

rfc 8482            minimal responses for any queries       january 2019\
\
\
1.  introduction\
\
   the domain name system (dns) specifies a query type (qtype) "any".\
   the operator of an authoritative dns server might choose not to\
   respond to such queries for reasons of local policy, motivated by\
   security, performance, or other reasons.\
\
   the dns specification [rfc1034] [rfc1035] does not include specific\
   guidance for the behavior of dns servers or clients in this\
   situation.  this document aims to provide such guidance.\
\
1.1.  terminology\
\
   this document uses terminology specific to the domain name system\
   (dns), descriptions of which can be found in [rfc8499].\
\
   [rfc1035] defined type 255 to be "*".  however, dns implementations\
   commonly use the keyword "any" to refer to that type code; this\
   document follows that common usage.\
\
   in this document, "any query" refers to a dns meta-query with\
   qtype=any.  an "any response" is a response to such a query.\
\
   in this document, "conventional any response" means an any response\
   that is constructed in accordance with the algorithm documented in\
   section 4.3.2 of [rfc1034] and specifically without implementing any\
   of the mechanisms described in this document.\
\
   in an exchange of dns messages between two hosts, this document\
   refers to the host sending a dns request as the "initiator" and the\
   host sending a dns response as the "responder".\
\
   the key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",\
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "not recommended", "may", and\
   "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   bcp 14 [rfc2119] [rfc8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
2.  motivations for use of any queries\
\
   any queries are legitimately used for debugging and checking the\
   state of a dns server for a particular name.\
\
   any queries are sometimes used as an attempt to reduce the number of\
   queries needed to get information, e.g., to obtain mx, a, and aaaa\
   resource record sets (rrsets) for a mail domain in a single query.\
   however, there is no documented guidance available for this use case,\
   and some implementations have been observed not to function as their\
\

\
rfc 8482            minimal responses for any queries       january 2019\
\
\
   developers expected.  if implementers assume that an any query will\
   ultimately be received by an authoritative server and will fetch all\
   existing rrsets, they should include a fallback mechanism to use when\
   that does not happen.\
\
   any queries are frequently used to exploit the amplification\
   potential of dns servers and resolvers using spoofed source addresses\
   and udp transport (see [rfc5358]).  having the ability to return\
   small responses to such queries makes dns servers less attractive\
   amplifiers.\
\
   any queries are sometimes used to help mine authoritative-only dns\
   servers for zone data, since they are expected to return all rrsets\
   for a particular query name.  if dns operators prefer to reduce the\
   potential for information leaks, they might choose not to send large\
   any responses.\
\
   some authoritative-only dns server implementations require additional\
   processing in order to send a conventional any response; avoiding\
   that processing expense might be desirable.\
\
3.  general approach\
\
   this proposal provides a mechanism for an authoritative dns server to\
   signal that conventional any queries are not supported for a\
   particular qname.  it does so in a way that is both compatible with\
   and triggers desirable behavior by unmodified clients (e.g., dns\
   resolvers).\
\
   alternative proposals for dealing with any queries have been\
   discussed.  one approach proposes using a new rcode to signal that an\
   authoritative server did not answer any queries in the standard way.\
   this approach was found to have an undesirable effect on both\
   resolvers and authoritative-only servers; resolvers receiving an\
   unknown rcode would resend the same query to all available\
   authoritative servers rather than suppress future any queries for the\
   same qname.\
\
   the proposal described in this document avoids that outcome by\
   returning a non-empty rrset in the any response, which provides\
   resolvers with something to cache and effectively suppresses repeat\
   queries to the same or different authoritative dns servers.\

\
\
4.  behavior of dns responders\
\
   below are the three different modes of behavior by dns responders\
   when processing queries with qnames that exist, qclass=in, and\
   qtype=any.  operators and implementers are free to choose whichever\
   mechanism best suits their environment.\
\
   1.  a dns responder can choose to select one or a larger subset of\
       the available rrsets at the qname.\
\
   2.  a dns responder can return a synthesized hinfo resource record.\
       see section 6 for discussion of the use of hinfo.\
\
   3.  a resolver can try to give out the most likely records the\
       requester wants.  this is not always possible, and the result\
       might well be a large response.\
\
   except as described below in this section, the dns responder must\
   follow the standard algorithms when constructing a response.\
\
4.1.  answer with a subset of available rrsets\
\
   a dns responder that receives an any query may decline to provide a\
   conventional any response or may instead send a response with a\
   single rrset (or a larger subset of available rrsets) in the answer\
   section.\
\
   the rrsets returned in the answer section of the response may consist\
   of a single rrset owned by the name specified in the qname.  where\
   multiple rrsets exist, the responder should choose a small subset of\
   those available to reduce the amplification potential of the\
   response.\
\
   if the zone is signed, appropriate rrsig records must be included in\
   the answer.\
\
   note that this mechanism does not provide any signaling to indicate\
   to a client that an incomplete subset of the available rrsets has\
   been returned.\
\
4.2.  answer with a synthesized hinfo rrset\
\
   if there is no cname present at the owner name matching the qname,\
   the resource record returned in the response may instead be\
   synthesized.  in this case, a single hinfo resource record should be\
   returned.  the cpu field of the hinfo rdata should be set to\
   "rfc8482".  the os field of the hinfo rdata should be set to the null\
   string to minimize the size of the response.\
\

rfc 8482            minimal responses for any queries       january 2019\
\
\
   the ttl encoded for the synthesized hinfo resource record should be\
   chosen by the operator of the dns responder to be large enough to\
   suppress frequent subsequent any queries from the same initiator with\
   the same qname, understanding that a ttl that is too long might make\
   policy changes relating to any queries difficult to change in the\
   future.  the specific value used should be configurable by the\
   operator of the nameserver according to local policy, based on the\
   familiar considerations involved in choosing a ttl value for any\
   resource record in any zone.\
\
   if the dns query includes do=1 and the qname corresponds to a zone\
   that is known by the responder to be signed, a valid rrsig for the\
   rrsets in the answer (or authority if answer is empty) section must\
   be returned.  in the case of do=0, the rrsig should be omitted.\
\
   a system that receives an hinfo response should not infer that the\
   response was generated according to this specification and apply any\
   special processing of the response because, in general, it is not\
   possible to tell with certainty whether the hinfo rrset received was\
   synthesized.  in particular, systems should not rely upon the hinfo\
   rdata described in this section to distinguish between synthesized\
   and non-synthesized hinfo rrsets.\
\
4.3.  answer with best guess as to intention\
\
   in some cases, it is possible to guess what the initiator wants in\
   the answer (but not always).  some implementations have implemented\
   the spirit of this document by returning all rrsets of rrtype cname,\
   mx, a, and aaaa that are present at the owner name while suppressing\
   others.  this heuristic seems to work well in practice; it satisfies\
   the needs of some applications whilst suppressing other rrsets such\
   as txt and dnskey that can often contribute to large responses.\
   whilst some applications may be satisfied by this behavior, the\
   resulting responses in the general case are larger than in the\
   approaches described in sections 4.1 and 4.2.\
\
   as before, if the zone is signed and the do bit is set on the\
   corresponding query, an rrsig rrset must be included in the response.\
\
4.4.  transport considerations\
\
   a dns responder may behave differently when processing any queries\
   received over different transports, e.g., by providing a conventional\
   any response over tcp whilst using one of the other mechanisms\
   specified in this document in the case where a query was received\
   using udp.\

\
\
   implementers may provide configuration options to allow operators to\
   specify different behavior over different transports.\
\
5.  behavior of dns initiators\
\
   a dns initiator that sends a query with qtype=any and receives a\
   response containing an hinfo resource record or a single rrset, as\
   described in section 4, may cache the response in the normal way.\
   such cached resource records should be retained in the cache\
   following normal caching semantics, as with any other response\
   received from a dns responder.\
\
   a dns initiator may suppress queries with qtype=any in the event that\
   the local cache contains a matching hinfo resource record with the\
   cpu field of the hinfo rdata, as described in section 4.  a dns\
   initiator may instead respond to such queries with the contents of\
   the local cache in the usual way.\
\
6.  hinfo considerations\
\
   it is possible that the synthesized hinfo rrset in an any response,\
   once cached by the initiator, might suppress subsequent queries from\
   the same initiator with qtype=hinfo.  thus, the use of hinfo in this\
   proposal would effectively mask the hinfo rrset present in the zone.\
\
   operators of authoritative servers who serve zones that rely upon\
   conventional use of the hinfo rrtype should sensibly choose the\
   "single rrset" method described in this document or select another\
   type.\
\
   the hinfo rrtype is believed to be rarely used in the dns at the time\
   of writing, based on observations made in passive dns and at\
   recursive and authoritative dns servers.\
\
7.  updates to rfcs 1034 and 1035\
\
   this document extends the specification for processing any queries\
   described in section 4.3.2 of [rfc1034].\
\
   it is important to note that returning a subset of available rrsets\
   when processing an any query is legitimate and consistent with\
   [rfc1035]; it can be argued that any does not always mean all, as\
   used in section 3.2.3 of [rfc1035].  the main difference here is that\
   the tc bit should not be set in the response, thus indicating that\
   this is not a complete answer.\

rfc 8482            minimal responses for any queries       january 2019\
\
\
   this document describes optional behavior for both dns initiators and\
   responders; implementation of the guidance provided by this document\
   is optional.\
\
   rrsig queries (i.e., queries with qtype=rrsig) are similar to any\
   queries in the sense that they have the potential to generate large\
   responses as well as extra work for the responders that process them,\
   e.g., in the case where signatures are generated on the fly.  rrsig\
   rrsets are not usually obtained using such explicit queries but are\
   rather included in the responses for other rrsets that the rrsigs\
   cover.  this document does not specify appropriate behavior for rrsig\
   queries; however, future such advice might well benefit from\
   consistency with and experience with the approaches for any queries\
   described here.\
\
8.  implementation experience\
\
   in october 2015, the cloudflare authoritative nameserver\
   implementation implemented the hinfo response.  a few minor problems\
   were reported and have since been resolved.\
\
   an implementation of the subset-mode response to any queries was\
   implemented in nsd 4.1 in 2016.\
\
   an implementation of a single rrset response to an any query was made\
   for bind9 by tony finch, and that functionality was subsequently made\
   available in production releases starting in bind 9.11.\
\
9.  security considerations\
\
   queries with qtype=any are frequently observed as part of reflection\
   attacks, since a relatively small query can be used to elicit a large\
   response.  this is a desirable characteristic if the goal is to\
   maximize the amplification potential of a dns server as part of a\
   volumetric attack.  the ability of a dns operator to suppress such\
   responses on a particular server makes that server a less useful\
   amplifier.\
\
   the optional behavior described in this document to reduce the size\
   of responses to queries with qtype=any is compatible with the use of\
   dnssec by both initiator and responder.\

                storing validation parameters in pkcs#8\
\
abstract\
\
   this memo describes a method of storing parameters needed for\
   private-key validation in the private-key information syntax\
   specification as defined in pkcs#8 format (rfc 5208).  it is equally\
   applicable to the alternative implementation of the private-key\
   information syntax specification as defined in rfc 5958.\
\
   the approach described in this document encodes the parameters under\
   a private enterprise extension and does not form part of a formal\
   standard.\

rfc 8479         storing validation parameters in pkcs#8  september 2018\
\
\
1.  introduction\
\
   rsa or dsa private keys generated using the shawe-taylor prime\
   generation algorithm described in [fips186-4] allow for parameter\
   validation, i.e., they verify whether the primes are actually prime\
   and were correctly generated.  that is done by generating the\
   parameters from a known seed and a selected hash algorithm.\
\
   storing these parameters in a private-key format such as the rsa\
   private-key syntax from pkcs#1 [rfc8017] or common representations\
   for dsa private keys does not allow information needed for validation\
   to be attached to the parameters.  the purpose of this document is to\
   describe such a method using the private-key information syntax\
   specification as defined in [rfc5208] and the alternative\
   specification described in [rfc5958].\
\
   the approach described in this document encodes the parameters under\
   a private enterprise extension and does not form part of a formal\
   standard.  the encoding can be used as is or as the basis for a\
   standard at a later time.\
\
2.  validationparams attribute\
\
   the information related to the validation parameters is stored as an\
   attribute in the privatekeyinfo structure.  the attribute is\
   identified by the id-attr-validation-parameters object identifier and\
   contains as attributevalue a single validationparams structure.\
\
     id-attr-validation-parameters object identifier ::=\
                                              {1 3 6 1 4 1 2312 18 8 1}\
\
     validationparams ::= sequence {\
         hashalgo object identifier,\
         seed octet string\
     }\
\
   the algorithm identifier in validationparams should be a hash\
   algorithm identifier for the methods described in [fips186-4].  the\
   validationparams sequence must be der encoded [itu-t-x690].\

            clarifications to bgp origin validation based on\

\
abstract\
\
   deployment of bgp origin validation based on resource public key\
   infrastructure (rpki) is hampered by, among other things, vendor\
   misimplementations in two critical areas: which routes are validated\
   and whether policy is applied when not specified by configuration.\
   this document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings causing\
   those misimplementations; it thus updates rfc 6811 by clarifying that\
   all prefixes should have their validation state set and that policy\
   must not be applied without operator configuration.\

1.  introduction\
\
   deployment of rpki-based bgp origin validation is hampered by, among\
   other things, vendor misimplementations in two critical areas: which\
   routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified\
   by configuration.  this document is meant to clarify possible\
   misunderstandings causing those misimplementations.\
\
   when a route is distributed into bgp, the origin validation state is\
   set to notfound, valid, or invalid per [rfc6811].  operational\
   testing has shown that the specifications of that rfc were not\
   sufficient to avoid divergent implementations.  this document\
   attempts to clarify two areas which seem to cause confusion.\
\
   the implementation issues seem not to be about how to validate, i.e.,\
   how to decide if a route is notfound, valid, or invalid.  the issues\
   seem to be which routes should be evaluated and have their evaluation\
   state set, and whether to apply policy without operator\
   configuration.\

\
\
2.  requirements language\
\
   the key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",\
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "not recommended", "may", and\
   "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   bcp 14 [rfc2119] [rfc8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
3.  suggested reading\
\
   it is assumed that the reader understands bgp [rfc4271], the rpki\
   [rfc6480], route origin authorizations (roas) [rfc6482], and\
   rpki-based prefix validation [rfc6811].\
\
4.  evaluate all prefixes\
\
   significant clarification: a router must evaluate and set the\
   validation state of all routes in bgp coming from any source (e.g.,\
   ebgp, ibgp, or redistribution from static or connected routes),\
   unless specifically configured otherwise by the operator.  otherwise,\
   the operator does not have the ability to drop invalid routes coming\
   from every potential source and is therefore liable to complaints\
   from neighbors about propagation of invalid routes.  for this reason,\
   [rfc6811] says:\
\
      when a bgp speaker receives an update from a neighbor, it should\
      perform a lookup as described above for each of the routes in the\
      update message.  the lookup should also be applied to routes that\
      are redistributed into bgp from another source, such as another\
      protocol or a locally defined static route.\
\
   [rfc6811] goes on to say, "an implementation may provide\
   configuration options to control which routes the lookup is applied\
   to."\
\
   when redistributing into bgp from any source (e.g., igp, ibgp, or\
   from static or connected routes), there is no as_path in the input to\
   allow rpki validation of the originating autonomous system (as).  in\
   such cases, the router must use the as of the router's bgp\
   configuration.  if that is ambiguous because of confederation, as\
   migration, or other multi-as configuration, then the router\
   configuration must provide a means of specifying the as to be used on\
   the redistribution, either per redistribution or globally.\

rfc 8481             origin validation clarification      september 2018\
\
\
5.  set state, don't act\
\
   significant clarification: once routes are evaluated and have their\
   state set, the operator should be in complete control of any policy\
   applied based on the evaluation state.  absent specific operator\
   configuration, policy must not be applied.\
\
   automatic origin validation policy actions such as those described in\
   "bgp prefix origin validation state extended community" [rfc8097]\
   must not be carried out or otherwise applied unless specifically\
   configured by the operator.\
\
6.  security considerations\
\
   this document does not create security considerations beyond those of\
   [rfc6811].\
\
7.  iana considerations\
\
   this document has no iana actions.\

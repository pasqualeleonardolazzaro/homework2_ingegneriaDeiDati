              Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) Overview\
\
Abstract\
\
   Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are wireless technologies with\
   characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly\
   very small packet and application-layer data sizes, and long battery\
   life operation.  This memo is an informational overview of the set of\
   LPWAN technologies being considered in the IETF and of the gaps that\
   exist between the needs of those technologies and the goal of running\
   IP in LPWANs.\

RFC 8376                     LPWAN Overview                     May 2018\
\
\
   Most technologies in this space aim for a similar goal of supporting\
   large numbers of very low-cost, low-throughput devices with very low\
   power consumption, so that even battery-powered devices can be\
   deployed for years.  LPWAN devices also tend to be constrained in\
   their use of bandwidth, for example, with limited frequencies being\
   allowed to be used within limited duty cycles (usually expressed as a\
   percentage of time per hour that the device is allowed to transmit).\
   As the name implies, coverage of large areas is also a common goal.\
   So, by and large, the different technologies aim for deployment in\
   very similar circumstances.\
\
   While all constrained networks must balance power consumption /\
   battery life, cost, and bandwidth, LPWANs prioritize power and cost\
   benefits by accepting severe bandwidth and duty cycle constraints\
   when making the required trade-offs.  This prioritization is made in\
   order to get the multiple-kilometer radio links implied by "Wide\
   Area" in LPWAN's name.\
\
   Existing pilot deployments have shown huge potential and created much\
   industrial interest in these technologies.  At the time of writing,\
   essentially no LPWAN end devices (other than for Wi-SUN) have IP\
   capabilities.  Connecting LPWANs to the Internet would provide\
   significant benefits to these networks in terms of interoperability,\
   application deployment, and management (among others).  The goal of\
   the LPWAN WG is to, where necessary, adapt IETF-defined protocols,\
   addressing schemes, and naming conventions to this particular\
   constrained environment.\
\
   This document is largely the work of the people listed in the\
   Contributors section.\
\
2.  LPWAN Technologies\
\
   This section provides an overview of the set of LPWAN technologies\
   that are being considered in the LPWAN WG.  The text for each was\
   mainly contributed by proponents of each technology.\
\
   Note that this text is not intended to be normative in any sense; it\
   simply exists to help the reader in finding the relevant Layer 2 (L2)\
   specifications and in understanding how those integrate with IETF-\
   defined technologies.  Similarly, there is no attempt here to set out\
   the pros and cons of the relevant technologies.\

\
2.1.  LoRaWAN\
\
2.1.1.  Provenance and Documents\
\
   LoRaWAN is a wireless technology based on Industrial, Scientific, and\
   Medical (ISM) that is used for long-range low-power low-data-rate\
   applications developed by the LoRa Alliance, a membership consortium\
   <https://www.lora-alliance.org/>.  This document is based on Version\
   1.0.2 of the LoRa specification [LoRaSpec].  That specification is\
   publicly available and has already seen several deployments across\
   the globe.\
\
2.1.2.  Characteristics\
\
   LoRaWAN aims to support end devices operating on a single battery for\
   an extended period of time (e.g., 10 years or more), extended\
   coverage through 155 dB maximum coupling loss, and reliable and\
   efficient file download (as needed for remote software/firmware\
   upgrade).\
\
   LoRaWAN networks are typically organized in a star-of-stars topology\
   in which Gateways relay messages between end devices and a central\
   "network server" in the backend.  Gateways are connected to the\
   network server via IP links while end devices use single-hop LoRaWAN\
   communication that can be received at one or more Gateways.\
   Communication is generally bidirectional; uplink communication from\
   end devices to the network server is favored in terms of overall\
   bandwidth availability.\
\
   Figure 1 shows the entities involved in a LoRaWAN network.\

\
\
   o  End Device: a LoRa client device, sometimes called a "mote".\
      Communicates with Gateways.\
\
   o  Gateway: a radio on the infrastructure side, sometimes called a\
      "concentrator" or "base station".  Communicates with end devices\
      and, via IP, with a network server.\
\
   o  Network Server: The Network Server (NS) terminates the LoRaWAN\
      Medium Access Control (MAC) layer for the end devices connected to\
      the network.  It is the center of the star topology.\
\
   o  Join Server: The Join Server (JS) is a server on the Internet side\
      of an NS that processes join requests from an end devices.\
\
   o  Uplink message: refers to communications from an end device to a\
      network server or application via one or more Gateways.\
\
   o  Downlink message: refers to communications from a network server\
      or application via one Gateway to a single end device or a group\
      of end devices (considering multicasting).\
\
   o  Application: refers to application-layer code both on the end\
      device and running "behind" the NS.  For LoRaWAN, there will\
      generally only be one application running on most end devices.\
      Interfaces between the NS and the application are not further\
      described here.\
\
   In LoRaWAN networks, end device transmissions may be received at\
   multiple Gateways, so, during nominal operation, a network server may\
   see multiple instances of the same uplink message from an end device.\
\
   The LoRaWAN network infrastructure manages the data rate and Radio\
   Frequency (RF) output power for each end device individually by means\
   of an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme.  End devices may transmit on\
   any channel allowed by local regulation at any time.\
\
   LoRaWAN radios make use of ISM bands, for example, 433 MHz and 868\
   MHz within the European Union and 915 MHz in the Americas.\
\
   The end device changes channels in a pseudorandom fashion for every\
   transmission to help make the system more robust to interference and/\
   or to conform to local regulations.\

\
\
   Figure 2 shows that after a transmission slot, a Class A device turns\
   on its receiver for two short receive windows that are offset from\
   the end of the transmission window.  End devices can only transmit a\
   subsequent uplink frame after the end of the associated receive\
   windows.  When a device joins a LoRaWAN network, there are similar\
   timeouts on parts of that process.\

   Given the different regional requirements, the detailed specification\
   for the LoRaWAN Physical layer (PHY) (taking up more than 30 pages of\
   the specification) is not reproduced here.  Instead, and mainly to\
   illustrate the kinds of issue encountered, Table 1 presents some of\
   the default settings for one ISM band (without fully explaining those\
   here); Table 2 describes maxima and minima for some parameters of\
   interest to those defining ways to use IETF protocols over the\
   LoRaWAN MAC layer.\

         Table 2: Minima and Maxima for Various LoRaWAN Parameters\
\
   Note that, in the case of the smallest frame size (19 octets), 8\
   octets are required for LoRa MAC layer headers, leaving only 11\
   octets for payload (including MAC layer options).  However, those\
   settings do not apply for the join procedure -- end devices are\
   required to use a channel and data rate that can send the 23-byte\
   Join-Request message for the join procedure.\
\
   Uplink and downlink higher-layer data is carried in a MACPayload.\
   There is a concept of "ports" (an optional 8-bit value) to handle\
   different applications on an end device.  Port zero is reserved for\
   LoRaWAN-specific messaging, such as the configuration of the end\
   device's network parameters (available channels, data rates, ADR\
   parameters, Rx Delay 1 and 2, etc.).\
\
   In addition to carrying higher-layer PDUs, there are Join-Request and\
   Join-Response (aka Join-Accept) messages for handling network access.\
   And so-called "MAC commands" (see below) up to 15 bytes long can be\
   piggybacked in an options field ("FOpts").\
\
   There are a number of MAC commands for link and device status\
   checking, ADR and duty cycle negotiation, and managing the RX windows\
   and radio channel settings.  For example, the link check response\
   message allows the NS (in response to a request from an end device)\
   to inform an end device about the signal attenuation seen most\
   recently at a Gateway and to tell the end device how many Gateways\
   received the corresponding link request MAC command.\

\
\
   Some MAC commands are initiated by the network server.  For example,\
   one command allows the network server to ask an end device to reduce\
   its duty cycle to only use a proportion of the maximum allowed in a\
   region.  Another allows the network server to query the end device's\
   power status with the response from the end device specifying whether\
   it has an external power source or is battery powered (in which case,\
   a relative battery level is also sent to the network server).\
\
   In order to operate nominally on a LoRaWAN network, a device needs a\
   32-bit device address, which is assigned when the device "joins" the\
   network (see below for the join procedure) or that is pre-provisioned\
   into the device.  In case of roaming devices, the device address is\
   assigned based on the 24-bit network identifier (NetID) that is\
   allocated to the network by the LoRa Alliance.  Non-roaming devices\
   can be assigned device addresses by the network without relying on a\
   NetID assigned by the LoRa Alliance.\
\
   End devices are assumed to work with one or quite a limited number of\
   applications, identified by a 64-bit AppEUI, which is assumed to be a\
   registered IEEE EUI64 value [EUI64].  In addition, a device needs to\
   have two symmetric session keys, one for protecting network artifacts\
   (port=0), the NwkSKey, and another for protecting application-layer\
   traffic, the AppSKey.  Both keys are used for 128-bit AES\
   cryptographic operations.  So, one option is for an end device to\
   have all of the above plus channel information, somehow\
   (pre-)provisioned; in that case, the end device can simply start\
   transmitting.  This is achievable in many cases via out-of-band means\
   given the nature of LoRaWAN networks.  Table 3 summarizes these\
   values.\

\
   As an alternative, end devices can use the LoRaWAN join procedure\
   with a join server behind the NS in order to set up some of these\
   values and dynamically gain access to the network.  To use the join\
   procedure, an end device must still know the AppEUI and a different\
   (long-term) symmetric key that is bound to the AppEUI (this is the\
   application key (AppKey), and it is distinct from the application\
   session key (AppSKey)).  The AppKey is required to be specific to the\
   device; that is, each end device should have a different AppKey\
   value.  Finally, the end device also needs a long-term identifier for\
   itself, which is syntactically also an EUI-64 and is known as the\
   device EUI or DevEUI.  Table 4 summarizes these values.\

     +---------+----------------------------------------------------+\
\
                Table 4: Values Required for Join Procedure\
\
   The join procedure involves a special exchange where the end device\
   asserts the AppEUI and DevEUI (integrity protected with the long-term\
   AppKey, but not encrypted) in a Join-Request uplink message.  This is\
   then routed to the network server, which interacts with an entity\
   that knows that AppKey to verify the Join-Request.  If all is going\
   well, a Join-Accept downlink message is returned from the network\
   server to the end device.  That message specifies the 24-bit NetID,\
   32-bit DevAddr, and channel information and from which the AppSKey\
   and NwkSKey can be derived based on knowledge of the AppKey.  This\
   provides the end device with all the values listed in Table 3.\
\
   All payloads are encrypted and have data integrity.  MAC commands,\
   when sent as a payload (port zero), are therefore protected.\
   However, MAC commands piggybacked as frame options ("FOpts") are sent\
   in clear.  Any MAC commands sent as frame options and not only as\
   payload, are visible to a passive attacker, but they are not\
   malleable for an active attacker due to the use of the Message\
   Integrity Check (MIC) described below.\
\
   For LoRaWAN version 1.0.x, the NwkSKey session key is used to provide\
   data integrity between the end device and the network server.  The\
   AppSKey is used to provide data confidentiality between the end\
   device and network server, or to the application "behind" the network\
   server, depending on the implementation of the network.\

\
\
   All MAC-layer messages have an outer 32-bit MIC calculated using AES-\
   CMAC with the input being the ciphertext payload and other headers\
   and using the NwkSkey.  Payloads are encrypted using AES-128, with a\
   counter-mode derived from [IEEE.802.15.4] using the AppSKey.\
   Gateways are not expected to be provided with the AppSKey or NwkSKey,\
   all of the infrastructure-side cryptography happens in (or "behind")\
   the network server.  When session keys are derived from the AppKey as\
   a result of the join procedure, the Join-Accept message payload is\
   specially handled.\
\
   The long-term AppKey is directly used to protect the Join-Accept\
   message content, but the function used is not an AES-encrypt\
   operation, but rather an AES-decrypt operation.  The justification is\
   that this means that the end device only needs to implement the AES-\
   encrypt operation.  (The counter-mode variant used for payload\
   decryption means the end device doesn't need an AES-decrypt\
   primitive.)\
\
   The Join-Accept plaintext is always less than 16 bytes long, so\
   Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode is used for protecting Join-Accept\
   messages.  The Join-Accept message contains an AppNonce (a 24-bit\
   value) that is recovered on the end device along with the other Join-\
   Accept content (e.g., DevAddr) using the AES-encrypt operation.  Once\
   the Join-Accept payload is available to the end device, the session\
   keys are derived from the AppKey, AppNonce, and other values, again\
   using an ECB mode AES-encrypt operation, with the plaintext input\
   being a maximum of 16 octets.\
\
2.2.  Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)\
\
2.2.1.  Provenance and Documents\
\
   Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has been developed and\
   standardized by 3GPP.  The standardization of NB-IoT was finalized\
   with 3GPP Release 13 in June 2016, and further enhancements for\
   NB-IoT are specified in 3GPP Release 14 in 2017 (for example, in the\
   form of multicast support).  Further features and improvements will\
   be developed in the following releases, but NB-IoT has been ready to\
   be deployed since 2016; it is rather simple to deploy, especially in\
   the existing LTE networks with a software upgrade in the operator's\
   base stations.  For more information of what has been specified for\
   NB-IoT, 3GPP specification 36.300 [TGPP36300] provides an overview\
   and overall description of the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio\
   Access Network (E-UTRAN) radio interface protocol architecture, while\
   specifications 36.321 [TGPP36321], 36.322 [TGPP36322], 36.323\
   [TGPP36323], and 36.331 [TGPP36331] give more detailed descriptions\

\
\
   of MAC, Radio Link Control (RLC), Packet Data Convergence Protocol\
   (PDCP), and Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layers,\
   respectively.  Note that the description below assumes familiarity\
   with numerous 3GPP terms.\
\
   For a general overview of NB-IoT, see [nbiot-ov].\
\
2.2.2.  Characteristics\
\
   Specific targets for NB-IoT include: module cost that is Less than US\
   $5, extended coverage of 164 dB maximum coupling loss, battery life\
   of over 10 years, ~55000 devices per cell, and uplink reporting\
   latency of less than 10 seconds.\
\
   NB-IoT supports Half Duplex Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) operation\
   mode with 60 kbit/s peak rate in uplink and 30 kbit/s peak rate in\
   downlink, and a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size of 1600 bytes,\
   limited by PDCP layer (see Figure 4 for the protocol structure),\
   which is the highest layer in the user plane, as explained later.\
   Any packet size up to the said MTU size can be passed to the NB-IoT\
   stack from higher layers, segmentation of the packet is performed in\
   the RLC layer, which can segment the data to transmission blocks with\
   a size as small as 16 bits.  As the name suggests, NB-IoT uses\
   narrowbands with bandwidth of 180 kHz in both downlink and uplink.\
   The multiple access scheme used in the downlink is Orthogonal\
   Frequency-Division Multiplex (OFDMA) with 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing.\
   In uplink, Sub-Carrier Frequency-Division Multiplex (SC-FDMA) single\
   tone with either 15kHz or 3.75 kHz tone spacing is used, or\
   optionally multi-tone SC-FDMA can be used with 15 kHz tone spacing.\
\
   NB-IoT can be deployed in three ways.  In-band deployment means that\
   the narrowband is deployed inside the LTE band and radio resources\
   are flexibly shared between NB-IoT and normal LTE carrier.  In Guard-\
   band deployment, the narrowband uses the unused resource blocks\
   between two adjacent LTE carriers.  Standalone deployment is also\
   supported, where the narrowband can be located alone in dedicated\
   spectrum, which makes it possible, for example, to reframe a GSM\
   carrier at 850/900 MHz for NB-IoT.  All three deployment modes are\
   used in licensed frequency bands.  The maximum transmission power is\
   either 20 or 23 dBm for uplink transmissions, while for downlink\
   transmission the eNodeB may use higher transmission power, up to 46\
   dBm depending on the deployment.\
\
   A Maximum Coupling Loss (MCL) target for NB-IoT coverage enhancements\
   defined by 3GPP is 164 dB.  With this MCL, the performance of NB-IoT\
   in downlink varies between 200 bps and 2-3 kbit/s, depending on the\
   deployment mode.  Stand-alone operation may achieve the highest data\

\
\
   rates, up to a few kbit/s, while in-band and guard-band operations\
   may reach several hundreds of bps.  NB-IoT may even operate with an\
   MCL higher than 170 dB with very low bit rates.\
\
   For signaling optimization, two options are introduced in addition to\
   the legacy LTE RRC connection setup; mandatory Data-over-NAS (Control\
   Plane optimization, solution 2 in [TGPP23720]) and optional RRC\
   Suspend/Resume (User Plane optimization, solution 18 in [TGPP23720]).\
   In the control-plane optimization, the data is sent over Non-Access\
   Stratum (NAS), directly to/from the Mobile Management Entity (MME)\
   (see Figure 3 for the network architecture) in the core network to\
   the User Equipment (UE) without interaction from the base station.\
   This means there is no Access Stratum security or header compression\
   provided by the PDCP layer in the eNodeB, as the Access Stratum is\
   bypassed, and only limited RRC procedures.  Header compression based\
   on Robust Header Compression (RoHC) may still optionally be provided\
   and terminated in the MME.\
\
   The RRC Suspend/Resume procedures reduce the signaling overhead\
   required for UE state transition from RRC Idle to RRC Connected mode\
   compared to a legacy LTE operation in order to have quicker user-\
   plane transaction with the network and return to RRC Idle mode\
   faster.\
\
   In order to prolong device battery life, both Power-Saving Mode (PSM)\
   and extended DRX (eDRX) are available to NB-IoT.  With eDRX, the RRC\
   Connected mode DRX cycle is up to 10.24 seconds; in RRC Idle, the\
   eDRX cycle can be up to 3 hours.  In PSM, the device is in a deep\
   sleep state and only wakes up for uplink reporting.  After the\
   reporting, there is a window (configured by the network) during which\
   the device receiver is open for downlink connectivity or for\
   periodical "keep-alive" signaling (PSM uses periodic TAU signaling\
   with additional reception windows for downlink reachability).\
\
   Since NB-IoT operates in a licensed spectrum, it has no channel\
   access restrictions allowing up to a 100% duty cycle.\
\
   3GPP access security is specified in [TGPP33203].\

\
   Figure 3 shows the 3GPP network architecture, which applies to\
   NB-IoT.  The MME is responsible for handling the mobility of the UE.\
   The MME tasks include tracking and paging UEs, session management,\
   choosing the Serving Gateway for the UE during initial attachment and\
   authenticating the user.  At the MME, the NAS signaling from the UE\
   is terminated.\
\
   The Serving Gateway (S-GW) routes and forwards the user data packets\
   through the access network and acts as a mobility anchor for UEs\
   during handover between base stations known as eNodeBs and also\
   during handovers between NB-IoT and other 3GPP technologies.\
\
   The Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) works as an interface between\
   the 3GPP network and external networks.\
\
   The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) contains user-related and\
   subscription-related information.  It is a database that performs\
   mobility management, session-establishment support, user\
   authentication, and access authorization.\
\
   E-UTRAN consists of components of a single type, eNodeB. eNodeB is a\
   base station that controls the UEs in one or several cells.\
\
   The 3GPP radio protocol architecture is illustrated in Figure 4.\

\
     Figure 4: 3GPP Radio Protocol Architecture for the Control Plane\
\
   The radio protocol architecture of NB-IoT (and LTE) is separated into\
   the control plane and the user plane.  The control plane consists of\
   protocols that control the radio-access bearers and the connection\
   between the UE and the network.  The highest layer of control plane\
   is called the Non-Access Stratum (NAS), which conveys the radio\
   signaling between the UE and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), passing\
   transparently through the radio network.  The NAS is responsible for\
   authentication, security control, mobility management, and bearer\
   management.\
\
   The Access Stratum (AS) is the functional layer below the NAS; in the\
   control plane, it consists of the Radio Resource Control (RRC)\
   protocol [TGPP36331], which handles connection establishment and\
   release functions, broadcast of system information, radio-bearer\
   establishment, reconfiguration, and release.  The RRC configures the\
   user and control planes according to the network status.  There exist\
   two RRC states, RRC_Idle or RRC_Connected, and the RRC entity\
   controls the switching between these states.  In RRC_Idle, the\
   network knows that the UE is present in the network, and the UE can\
   be reached in case of an incoming call/downlink data.  In this state,\
   the UE monitors paging, performs cell measurements and cell\
   selection, and acquires system information.  Also, the UE can receive\
   broadcast and multicast data, but it is not expected to transmit or\
   receive unicast data.  In RRC_Connected state, the UE has a\
   connection to the eNodeB, the network knows the UE location on the\
   cell level, and the UE may receive and transmit unicast data.  An RRC\
   connection is established when the UE is expected to be active in the\
   network, to transmit or receive data.  The RRC connection is\
   released, switching back to RRC_Idle, when there is no more traffic;\
   this is in order to preserve UE battery life and radio resources.\

\
\
   However, as mentioned earlier, a new feature was introduced for\
   NB-IoT that allows data to be transmitted from the MME directly to\
   the UE and then transparently to the eNodeB, thus bypassing AS\
   functions.\
\
   The PDCP's [TGPP36323] main services in the control plane are\
   transfer of control-plane data, ciphering, and integrity protection.\
\
   The RLC protocol [TGPP36322] performs transfer of upper-layer PDUs\
   and, optionally, error correction with Automatic Repeat reQuest\
   (ARQ), concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of RLC Service\
   Data Units (SDUs), in-sequence delivery of upper-layer PDUs,\
   duplicate detection, RLC SDU discarding, RLC-re-establishment, and\
   protocol error detection and recovery.\
\
   The MAC protocol [TGPP36321] provides mapping between logical\
   channels and transport channels, multiplexing of MAC SDUs, scheduling\
   information reporting, error correction with Hybrid ARQ (HARQ),\
   priority handling, and transport format selection.\
\
   The PHY [TGPP36201] provides data-transport services to higher\
   layers.  These include error detection and indication to higher\
   layers, Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoding, HARQ soft-combining,\
   rate-matching, mapping of the transport channels onto physical\
   channels, power-weighting and modulation of physical channels,\
   frequency and time synchronization, and radio characteristics\
   measurements.\
\
   The user plane is responsible for transferring the user data through\
   the Access Stratum.  It interfaces with IP and the highest layer of\
   the user plane is the PDCP, which, in the user plane, performs header\
   compression using RoHC, transfer of user-plane data between eNodeB\
   and the UE, ciphering, and integrity protection.  Similar to the\
   control plane, lower layers in the user plane include RLC, MAC, and\
   the PHY performing the same tasks as they do in the control plane.\

2.3.  Sigfox\

2.3.1.  Provenance and Documents\
\
   The Sigfox LPWAN is in line with the terminology and specifications\
   being defined by ETSI [etsi_unb].  As of today, Sigfox's network has\
   been fully deployed in 12 countries, with ongoing deployments in 26\
   other countries, giving in total a geography of 2 million square\
   kilometers, containing 512 million people.\

\
\
2.3.2.  Characteristics\
\
   Sigfox LPWAN autonomous battery-operated devices send only a few\
   bytes per day, week, or month, in principle, allowing them to remain\
   on a single battery for up to 10-15 years.  Hence, the system is\
   designed as to allow devices to last several years, sometimes even\
   buried underground.\
\
   Since the radio protocol is connectionless and optimized for uplink\
   communications, the capacity of a Sigfox base station depends on the\
   number of messages generated by devices, and not on the actual number\
   of devices.  Likewise, the battery life of devices depends on the\
   number of messages generated by the device.  Depending on the use\
   case, devices can vary from sending less than one message per device\
   per day to dozens of messages per device per day.\
\
   The coverage of the cell depends on the link budget and on the type\
   of deployment (urban, rural, etc.).  The radio interface is compliant\
   with the following regulations:\
\
      Spectrum allocation in the USA [fcc_ref]\
\
      Spectrum allocation in Europe [etsi_ref1] [etsi_ref2]\
\
      Spectrum allocation in Japan [arib_ref]\
\
   The Sigfox radio interface is also compliant with the local\
   regulations of the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada,\
   Kenya, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Peru,\
   Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Thailand.\
\
   The radio interface is based on Ultra Narrow Band (UNB)\
   communications, which allow an increased transmission range by\
   spending a limited amount of energy at the device.  Moreover, UNB\
   allows a large number of devices to coexist in a given cell without\
   significantly increasing the spectrum interference.\
\
   Both uplink and downlink are supported, although the system is\
   optimized for uplink communications.  Due to spectrum optimizations,\
   different uplink and downlink frames and time synchronization methods\
   are needed.\
\
   The main radio characteristics of the UNB uplink transmission are:\
\
   o  Channelization mask: 100 Hz / 600 Hz (depending on the region)\
\
   o  Uplink baud rate: 100 baud / 600 baud (depending on the region)\

\
   o  Link budget: 155 dB (or better)\
\
   o  Central frequency accuracy: not relevant, provided there is no\
      significant frequency drift within an uplink packet transmission\
\
   For example, in Europe, the UNB uplink frequency band is limited to\
   868.00 to 868.60 MHz, with a maximum output power of 25 mW and a duty\
   cycle of 1%.\

\
   The uplink frame is composed of the following fields:\
\
   o  Preamble: 19 bits\

   o  Frame sync and header: 29 bits\

   o  Channelization mask: 1.5 kHz\
\
   o  Downlink baud rate: 600 baud\
\

\
\
   o  Central frequency accuracy: the center frequency of downlink\
      transmission is set by the network according to the corresponding\
      uplink transmission.\
\
   For example, in Europe, the UNB downlink frequency band is limited to\
   869.40 to 869.65 MHz, with a maximum output power of 500 mW with 10%\
   duty cycle.\

\
                      Figure 6: Downlink Frame Format\
\
   The downlink frame is composed of the following fields:\
\
   o  Preamble: 91 bits\
\
   o  Frame sync and header: 13 bits\
\
   o  Error Correcting Code (ECC): 32 bits\
\
   o  Payload: 0-64 bits\
\
   o  Authentication: 16 bits\
\
   o  Frame check sequence: 8 bits (CRC)\
\
   The radio interface is optimized for uplink transmissions, which are\
   asynchronous.  Downlink communications are achieved by devices\
   querying the network for available data.\
\
   A device willing to receive downlink messages opens a fixed window\
   for reception after sending an uplink transmission.  The delay and\
   duration of this window have fixed values.  The network transmits the\
   downlink message for a given device during the reception window, and\
   the network also selects the BS for transmitting the corresponding\
   downlink message.\
\
   Uplink and downlink transmissions are unbalanced due to the\
   regulatory constraints on ISM bands.  Under the strictest\
   regulations, the system can allow a maximum of 140 uplink messages\

   and 4 downlink messages per device per day.  These restrictions can\
   be slightly relaxed depending on system conditions and the specific\
   regulatory domain of operation.\

\
                   Figure 7: Sigfox Network Architecture\
\
   Figure 7 depicts the different elements of the Sigfox network\
   architecture.\
\
   Sigfox has a "one-contract one-network" model allowing devices to\
   connect in any country, without any need or notion of either roaming\
   or handover.\
\
   The architecture consists of a single cloud-based core network, which\
   allows global connectivity with minimal impact on the end device and\
   radio access network.  The core network elements are the Service\
   Center (SC) and the Registration Authority (RA).  The SC is in charge\
   of the data connectivity between the BS and the Internet, as well as\
   the control and management of the BSs and End Points (EPs).  The RA\
   is in charge of the EP network access authorization.\
\
   The radio access network is comprised of several BSs connected\
   directly to the SC.  Each BS performs complex L1/L2 functions,\
   leaving some L2 and L3 functionalities to the SC.\
\
   The Devices (DEVs) or EPs are the objects that communicate\
   application data between local Device Applications (DAs) and Network\
   Applications (NAs).\

\
\
   Devices (or EPs) can be static or nomadic, as they associate with the\
   SC and they do not attach to any specific BS.  Hence, they can\
   communicate with the SC through one or multiple BSs.\
\
   Due to constraints in the complexity of the Device, it is assumed\
   that Devices host only one or very few device applications, which\
   most of the time communicate each to a single network application at\
   a time.\
\
   The radio protocol authenticates and ensures the integrity of each\
   message.  This is achieved by using a unique device ID and an\
   AES-128-based message authentication code, ensuring that the message\
   has been generated and sent by the device with the ID claimed in the\
   message.  Application data can be encrypted at the application level\
   or not, depending on the criticality of the use case, to provide a\
   balance between cost and effort versus risk.  AES-128 in counter mode\
   is used for encryption.  Cryptographic keys are independent for each\
   device.  These keys are associated with the device ID and separate\
   integrity and confidentiality keys are pre-provisioned.  A\
   confidentiality key is only provisioned if confidentiality is to be\
   used.  At the time of writing, the algorithms and keying details for\
   this are not published.\

2.4.  Wi-SUN Alliance Field Area Network (FAN)\
\
   Text here is via personal communication from Bob Heile\
   (bheile@ieee.org) and was authored by Bob and Sum Chin Sean.  Paul\
   Duffy (paduffy@cisco.com) also provided additional comments/input on\
   this section.\
\
2.4.1.  Provenance and Documents\
\
   The Wi-SUN Alliance <https://www.wi-sun.org/> is an industry alliance\
   for smart city, smart grid, smart utility, and a broad set of general\
   IoT applications.  The Wi-SUN Alliance Field Area Network (FAN)\
   profile is open-standards based (primarily on IETF and IEEE 802\
   standards) and was developed to address applications like smart\
   municipality/city infrastructure monitoring and management, Electric\
   Vehicle (EV) infrastructure, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI),\
   Distribution Automation (DA), Supervisory Control and Data\
   Acquisition (SCADA) protection/management, distributed generation\
   monitoring and management, and many more IoT applications.\
   Additionally, the Alliance has created a certification program to\
   promote global multi-vendor interoperability.\
\
   The FAN profile is specified within ANSI/TIA as an extension of work\
   previously done on Smart Utility Networks [ANSI-4957-000].  Updates\
   to those specifications intended to be published in 2017 will contain\

\
\
   details of the FAN profile.  A current snapshot of the work to\
   produce that profile is presented in [wisun-pressie1] and\
   [wisun-pressie2].\
\
2.4.2.  Characteristics\
\
   The FAN profile is an IPv6 wireless mesh network with support for\
   enterprise-level security.  The frequency-hopping wireless mesh\
   topology aims to offer superior network robustness, reliability due\
   to high redundancy, good scalability due to the flexible mesh\
   configuration, and good resilience to interference.  Very low power\
   modes are in development permitting long-term battery operation of\
   network nodes.\
\
   The following list contains some overall characteristics of Wi-SUN\
   that are relevant to LPWAN applications.\
\
   o  Coverage: The range of Wi-SUN FAN is typically 2 - 3 km in line of\
      sight, matching the needs of neighborhood area networks, campus\
      area networks, or corporate area networks.  The range can also be\
      extended via multi-hop networking.\
\
   o  High-bandwidth, low-link latency: Wi-SUN supports relatively high\
      bandwidth, i.e., up to 300 kbit/s [FANOV], enables remote update\
      and upgrade of devices so that they can handle new applications,\
      extending their working life.  Wi-SUN supports LPWAN IoT\
      applications that require on-demand control by providing low link\
      latency (0.02 s) and bidirectional communication.\
\
   o  Low-power consumption: FAN devices draw less than 2 uA when\
      resting and only 8 mA when listening.  Such devices can maintain a\
      long lifetime, even if they are frequently listening.  For\
      instance, suppose the device transmits data for 10 ms once every\
      10 s; theoretically, a battery of 1000 mAh can last more than 10\
      years.\
\
   o  Scalability: Tens of millions of Wi-SUN FAN devices have been\
      deployed in urban, suburban, and rural environments, including\
      deployments with more than 1 million devices.\
\
   A FAN contains one or more networks.  Within a network, nodes assume\
   one of three operational roles.  First, each network contains a\
   Border Router providing WAN connectivity to the network.  The Border\
   Router maintains source-routing tables for all nodes within its\
   network, provides node authentication and key management services,\
   and disseminates network-wide information such as broadcast\
   schedules.  Second, Router nodes, which provide upward and downward\
   packet forwarding (within a network).  A Router also provides\

\
\
   services for relaying security and address management protocols.\
   Finally, Leaf nodes provide minimum capabilities: discovering and\
   joining a network, sending/receiving IPv6 packets, etc.  A low-power\
   network may contain a mesh topology with Routers at the edges that\
   construct a star topology with Leaf nodes.\
\
   The FAN profile is based on various open standards developed by the\
   IETF (including [RFC768], [RFC2460], [RFC4443], and [RFC6282]).\
   Related IEEE 802 standards include [IEEE.802.15.4] and\
   [IEEE.802.15.9].  For Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), see ANSI/\
   TIA [ANSI-4957-210].\
\
   The FAN profile specification provides an application-independent\
   IPv6-based transport service.  There are two possible methods for\
   establishing IPv6 packet routing: the Routing Protocol for Low-Power\
   and Lossy Networks (RPL) at the Network layer is mandatory, and\
   Multi-Hop Delivery Service (MHDS) is optional at the Data Link layer.\
   Figure 8 provides an overview of the FAN network stack.\
\
   The Transport service is based on UDP (defined in [RFC768]) or TCP\
   (defined in [RFC793].\
\
   The Network service is provided by IPv6 as defined in [RFC2460] with\
   an IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN)\
   adaptation as defined in [RFC4944] and [RFC6282].  ICMPv6, as defined\
   in [RFC4443], is used for the control plane during information\
   exchange.\
\
   The Data Link service provides both control/management of the PHY and\
   data transfer/management services to the Network layer.  These\
   services are divided into MAC and Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-\
   layers.  The LLC sub-layer provides a protocol dispatch service that\
   supports 6LoWPAN and an optional MAC sub-layer mesh service.  The MAC\
   sub-layer is constructed using data structures defined in\
   [IEEE.802.15.4].  Multiple modes of frequency hopping are defined.\
   The entire MAC payload is encapsulated in an [IEEE.802.15.9]\
   Information Element to enable LLC protocol dispatch between upper-\
   layer 6LoWPAN processing and MAC sub-layer mesh processing, etc.\
   These areas will be expanded once [IEEE.802.15.12] is completed.\
\
   The PHY service is derived from a subset of the SUN FSK specification\
   in [IEEE.802.15.4].  The 2-FSK modulation schemes, with a channel-\
   spacing range from 200 to 600 kHz, are defined to provide data rates\
   from 50 to 300 kbit/s, with FEC as an optional feature.  Towards\
   enabling ultra-low-power applications, the PHY layer design is also\
   extendable to low-energy and critical infrastructure-monitoring\
   networks.\

RFC 8376                     LPWAN Overview                     May 2018\
\
\
   The FAN security supports Data Link layer network access control,\
   mutual authentication, and establishment of a secure pairwise link\
   between a FAN node and its Border Router, which is implemented with\
   an adaptation of [IEEE.802.1x] and EAP-TLS as described in [RFC5216]\
   using secure device identity as described in [IEEE.802.1AR].\
   Certificate formats are based upon [RFC5280].  A secure group link\
   between a Border Router and a set of FAN nodes is established using\
   an adaptation of the [IEEE.802.11] Four-Way Handshake.  A set of four\
   group keys are maintained within the network, one of which is the\
   current transmit key.  Secure node-to-node links are supported\
   between one-hop FAN neighbors using an adaptation of\
   [ETSI-TS-102-887-2].  FAN nodes implement Frame Security as specified\
   in [IEEE.802.15.4].\
\
3.  Generic Terminology\
\
   LPWAN technologies, such as those discussed above, have similar\
   architectures but different terminology.  We can identify different\
   types of entities in a typical LPWAN network:\
\
   o  End devices are the devices or the "things" (e.g., sensors,\
      actuators, etc.); they are named differently in each technology\
      (End Device, User Equipment, or EP).  There can be a high density\
      of end devices per Radio Gateway.\
\
   o  The Radio Gateway, which is the EP of the constrained link.  It is\
      known as: Gateway, Evolved Node B or base station.\
\
   o  The Network Gateway or Router is the interconnection node between\
      the Radio Gateway and the Internet.  It is known as the Network\
      Server, Serving GW, or Service Center.\
\
   o  LPWAN-AAA server, which controls user authentication.  It is known\
      as the Join-Server, Home Subscriber Server, or Registration\
      Authority.  (We use the term LPWAN-AAA server because we're not\
      assuming that this entity speaks RADIUS or Diameter as many/most\
      AAA servers do; but, equally, we don't want to rule that out, as\
      the functionality will be similar.)\
\
   o  At last we have the Application Server, known also as Packet Data\
      Node Gateway or Network Application.\

   In addition to the names of entities, LPWANs are also subject to\
   possibly regional frequency-band regulations.  Those may include\
   restrictions on the duty cycle, for example, requiring that hosts\
   only transmit for a certain percentage of each hour.\

\
\
4.  Gap Analysis\
\
   This section considers some of the gaps between current LPWAN\
   technologies and the goals of the LPWAN WG.  Many of the generic\
   considerations described in [RFC7452] will also apply in LPWANs, as\
   end devices can also be considered to be a subclass of (so-called)\
   "smart objects".  In addition, LPWAN device implementers will also\
   need to consider the issues relating to firmware updates described in\
   [RFC8240].\
\
4.1.  Naive Application of IPv6\
\
   IPv6 [RFC8200] has been designed to allocate addresses to all the\
   nodes connected to the Internet.  Nevertheless, the header overhead\
   of at least 40 bytes introduced by the protocol is incompatible with\
   LPWAN constraints.  If IPv6 with no further optimization were used,\
   several LPWAN frames could be needed just to carry the IP header.\
   Another problem arises from IPv6 MTU requirements, which require the\
   layer below to support at least 1280 byte packets [RFC2460].\
\
   IPv6 has a configuration protocol: Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)\
   [RFC4861]).  For a node to learn network parameters, NDP generates\
   regular traffic with a relatively large message size that does not\
   fit LPWAN constraints.\
\
   In some LPWAN technologies, L2 multicast is not supported.  In that\
   case, if the network topology is a star, the solution and\
   considerations from Section 3.2.5 of [RFC7668] may be applied.\
\
   Other key protocols (such as DHCPv6 [RFC3315], IPsec [RFC4301] and\
   TLS [RFC5246]) have similarly problematic properties in this context.\
   Each protocol requires relatively frequent round-trips between the\
   host and some other host on the network.  In the case of\
   cryptographic protocols (such as IPsec and TLS), in addition to the\
   round-trips required for secure session establishment, cryptographic\
   operations can require padding and addition of authenticators that\
   are problematic when considering LPWAN lower layers.  Note that mains\
   powered Wi-SUN mesh router nodes will typically be more resource\
   capable than the other LPWAN technologies discussed.  This can enable\
   use of more "chatty" protocols for some aspects of Wi-SUN.\
\
4.2.  6LoWPAN\
\
   Several technologies that exhibit significant constraints in various\
   dimensions have exploited the 6LoWPAN suite of specifications\
   ([RFC4944], [RFC6282], and [RFC6775]) to support IPv6 [USES-6LO].\
   However, the constraints of LPWANs, often more extreme than those\
   typical of technologies that have (re-)used 6LoWPAN, constitute a\
\
\
\
Farrell                       Informational                    [Page 26]\
\
RFC 8376                     LPWAN Overview                     May 2018\
\
\
   challenge for the 6LoWPAN suite in order to enable IPv6 over LPWAN.\
   LPWANs are characterized by device constraints (in terms of\
   processing capacity, memory, and energy availability), and\
   especially, link constraints, such as:\
\
   o  tiny L2 payload size (from ~10 to ~100 bytes),\
\
   o  very low bit rate (from ~10 bit/s to ~100 kbit/s), and\
\
   o  in some specific technologies, further message rate constraints\
      (e.g., between ~0.1 message/minute and ~1 message/minute) due to\
      regional regulations that limit the duty cycle.\
\
4.2.1.  Header Compression\
\
   6LoWPAN header compression reduces IPv6 (and UDP) header overhead by\
   eliding header fields when they can be derived from the link layer\
   and by assuming that some of the header fields will frequently carry\
   expected values. 6LoWPAN provides both stateless and stateful header\
   compression.  In the latter, all nodes of a 6LoWPAN are assumed to\
   share compression context.  In the best case, the IPv6 header for\
   link-local communication can be reduced to only 2 bytes.  For global\
   communication, the IPv6 header may be compressed down to 3 bytes in\
   the most extreme case.  However, in more practical situations, the\
   smallest IPv6 header size may be 11 bytes (one address prefix\
   compressed) or 19 bytes (both source and destination prefixes\
   compressed).  These headers are large considering the link-layer\
   payload size of LPWAN technologies, and in some cases, are even\
   bigger than the LPWAN PDUs. 6LoWPAN was initially designed for\
   [IEEE.802.15.4] networks with a frame size up to 127 bytes and a\
   throughput of up to 250 kbit/s, which may or may not be duty cycled.\
\
4.2.2.  Address Autoconfiguration\
\
   Traditionally, Interface Identifiers (IIDs) have been derived from\
   link-layer identifiers [RFC4944].  This allows optimizations such as\
   header compression.  Nevertheless, recent guidance has given advice\
   on the fact that, due to privacy concerns, 6LoWPAN devices should not\
   be configured to embed their link-layer addresses in the IID by\
   default.  [RFC8065] provides guidance on better methods for\
   generating IIDs.\
\
4.2.3.  Fragmentation\
\
   As stated above, IPv6 requires the layer below to support an MTU of\
   1280 bytes [RFC8200].  Therefore, given the low maximum payload size\
   of LPWAN technologies, fragmentation is needed.\
\
\
\
\
Farrell                       Informational                    [Page 27]\
\
RFC 8376                     LPWAN Overview                     May 2018\
\
\
   If a layer of an LPWAN technology supports fragmentation, proper\
   analysis has to be carried out to decide whether the fragmentation\
   functionality provided by the lower layer or fragmentation at the\
   adaptation layer should be used.  Otherwise, fragmentation\
   functionality shall be used at the adaptation layer.\
\
   6LoWPAN defined a fragmentation mechanism and a fragmentation header\
   to support the transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE.802.15.4\
   networks [RFC4944].  While the 6LoWPAN fragmentation header is\
   appropriate for the 2003 version of [IEEE.802.15.4] (which has a\
   frame payload size of 81-102 bytes), it is not suitable for several\
   LPWAN technologies, many of which have a maximum payload size that is\
   one order of magnitude below that of the 2003 version of\
   [IEEE.802.15.4].  The overhead of the 6LoWPAN fragmentation header is\
   high, considering the reduced payload size of LPWAN technologies, and\
   the limited energy availability of the devices using such\
   technologies.  Furthermore, its datagram offset field is expressed in\
   increments of eight octets.  In some LPWAN technologies, the 6LoWPAN\
   fragmentation header plus eight octets from the original datagram\
   exceeds the available space in the layer two payload.  In addition,\
   the MTU in the LPWAN networks could be variable, which implies a\
   variable fragmentation solution.\
\
4.2.4.  Neighbor Discovery\
\
   6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery [RFC6775] defines optimizations to IPv6 ND\
   [RFC4861], in order to adapt functionality of the latter for networks\
   of devices using [IEEE.802.15.4] or similar technologies.  The\
   optimizations comprise host-initiated interactions to allow for\
   sleeping hosts, replacement of multicast-based address resolution for\
   hosts by an address registration mechanism, multihop extensions for\
   prefix distribution and duplicate address detection (note that these\
   are not needed in a star topology network), and support for 6LoWPAN\
   header compression.\
\
   6LoWPAN ND may be used in not so severely constrained LPWAN networks.\
   The relative overhead incurred will depend on the LPWAN technology\
   used (and on its configuration, if appropriate).  In certain LPWAN\
   setups (with a maximum payload size above ~60 bytes and duty-cycle-\
   free or equivalent operation), an RS/RA/NS/NA exchange may be\
   completed in a few seconds, without incurring packet fragmentation.\
\
   In other LPWANs (with a maximum payload size of ~10 bytes and a\
   message rate of ~0.1 message/minute), the same exchange may take\
   hours or even days, leading to severe fragmentation and consuming a\
   significant amount of the available network resources.  6LoWPAN ND\
   behavior may be tuned through the use of appropriate values for the\
   default Router Lifetime, the Valid Lifetime in the PIOs, and the\
\
\

Farrell                       Informational                    [Page 28]\
\
RFC 8376                     LPWAN Overview                     May 2018\
\
\
   Valid Lifetime in the 6LoWPAN Context Option (6CO), as well as the\
   address Registration Lifetime.  However, for the latter LPWANs\
   mentioned above, 6LoWPAN ND is not suitable.\
\
4.3.  6lo\
\
   The 6lo WG has been reusing and adapting 6LoWPAN to enable IPv6\
   support over link-layer technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy\
   (BTLE), ITU-T G.9959 [G9959], Digital Enhanced Cordless\
   Telecommunications (DECT) Ultra Low Energy (ULE), MS/TP-RS485, Near\
   Field Communication (NFC) IEEE 802.11ah.  (See\
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/6lo/> for details on the 6lo WG.)\
   These technologies are similar in several aspects to [IEEE.802.15.4],\
   which was the original 6LoWPAN target technology.\
\
   6lo has mostly used the subset of 6LoWPAN techniques best suited for\
   each lower-layer technology and has provided additional optimizations\
   for technologies where the star topology is used, such as BTLE or\
   DECT-ULE.\
\
   The main constraint in these networks comes from the nature of the\
   devices (constrained devices); whereas, in LPWANs, it is the network\
   itself that imposes the most stringent constraints.\
\
4.4.  6tisch\
\
   The IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6tisch) solution is\
   dedicated to mesh networks that operate using [IEEE.802.15.4e] MAC\
   with a deterministic slotted channel.  Time-Slotted Channel Hopping\
   (TSCH) can help to reduce collisions and to enable a better balance\
   over the channels.  It improves the battery life by avoiding the idle\
   listening time for the return channel.\
\
   A key element of 6tisch is the use of synchronization to enable\
   determinism.  TSCH and 6tisch may provide a standard scheduling\
   function.  The LPWAN networks probably will not support\
   synchronization like the one used in 6tisch.\
\
4.5.  RoHC\
\
   RoHC is a header compression mechanism [RFC3095] developed for\
   multimedia flows in a point-to-point channel.  RoHC uses three levels\
   of compression, each level having its own header format.  In the\
   first level, RoHC sends 52 bytes of header; in the second level, the\
   header could be from 34 to 15 bytes; and in the third level, header\
   size could be from 7 to 2 bytes.  The level of compression is managed\
   by a Sequence Number (SN), which varies in size from 2 bytes to 4\
   bits in the minimal compression.  SN compression is done with an\
\
\
\
Farrell                       Informational                    [Page 29]\
\
RFC 8376                     LPWAN Overview                     May 2018\
\
\
   algorithm called Window-Least Significant Bits (W-LSB).  This window\
   has a 4-bit size representing 15 packets, so every 15 packets, RoHC\
   needs to slide the window in order to receive the correct SN, and\
   sliding the window implies a reduction of the level of compression.\
   When packets are lost or errored, the decompressor loses context and\
   drops packets until a bigger header is sent with more complete\
   information.  To estimate the performance of RoHC, an average header\
   size is used.  This average depends on the transmission conditions,\
   but most of the time is between 3 and 4 bytes.\
\
   RoHC has not been adapted specifically to the constrained hosts and\
   networks of LPWANs: it does not take into account energy limitations\
   nor the transmission rate.  Additionally, RoHC context is\
   synchronized during transmission, which does not allow better\
   compression.\
\
4.6.  ROLL\
\
   Most technologies considered by the LPWAN WG are based on a star\
   topology, which eliminates the need for routing at that layer.\
   Future work may address additional use cases that may require\
   adaptation of existing routing protocols or the definition of new\
   ones.  As of the time of writing, work similar to that done in the\
   Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy Network (ROLL) WG and other routing\
   protocols are out of scope of the LPWAN WG.\
\
4.7.  CoAP\
\
   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] provides a\
   RESTful framework for applications intended to run on constrained IP\
   networks.  It may be necessary to adapt CoAP or related protocols to\
   take into account the extreme duty cycles and the potentially\
   extremely limited throughput of LPWANs.\
\
   For example, some of the timers in CoAP may need to be redefined.\
   Taking into account CoAP acknowledgments may allow the reduction of\
   L2 acknowledgments.  On the other hand, the current work in progress\
   in the CoRE WG where the Constrained Management Interface (COMI) /\
   Constrained Objects Language (CoOL) network management interface\
   which, uses Structured Identifiers (SIDs) to reduce payload size over\
   CoAP may prove to be a good solution for the LPWAN technologies.  The\
   overhead is reduced by adding a dictionary that matches a URI to a\
   small identifier and a compact mapping of the YANG data model into\
   the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).\

\
\
4.8.  Mobility\
\
   LPWAN nodes can be mobile.  However, LPWAN mobility is different from\
   the one specified for Mobile IP.  LPWAN implies sporadic traffic and\
   will rarely be used for high-frequency, real-time communications.\
   The applications do not generate a flow; they need to save energy\
   and, most of the time, the node will be down.\
\
   In addition, LPWAN mobility may mostly apply to groups of devices\
   that represent a network; in which case, mobility is more a concern\
   for the Gateway than the devices.  Network Mobility (NEMO) [RFC3963]\
   or other mobile Gateway solutions (such as a Gateway with an LTE\
   uplink) may be used in the case where some end devices belonging to\
   the same network Gateway move from one point to another such that\
   they are not aware of being mobile.\
\
4.9.  DNS and LPWAN\
\
   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035], enables applications to name\
   things with a globally resolvable name.  Many protocols use the DNS\
   to identify hosts, for example, applications using CoAP.\
\
   The DNS query/answer protocol as a precursor to other communication\
   within the Time-To-Live (TTL) of a DNS answer is clearly problematic\
   in an LPWAN, say where only one round-trip per hour can be used, and\
   with a TTL that is less than 3600 seconds.  It is currently unclear\
   whether and how DNS-like functionality might be provided in LPWANs.\
\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   Most LPWAN technologies integrate some authentication or encryption\
   mechanisms that were defined outside the IETF.  The LPWAN WG may need\
   to do work to integrate these mechanisms to unify management.  A\
   standardized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\
   infrastructure [RFC2904] may offer a scalable solution for some of\
   the security and management issues for LPWANs.  AAA offers\
   centralized management that may be of use in LPWANs, for example\
   [LoRaWAN-AUTH] and [LoRaWAN-RADIUS] suggest possible security\
   processes for a LoRaWAN network.  Similar mechanisms may be useful to\
   explore for other LPWAN technologies.\
\
   Some applications using LPWANs may raise few or no privacy\
   considerations.  For example, temperature sensors in a large office\
   building may not raise privacy issues.  However, the same sensors, if\
   deployed in a home environment, and especially if triggered due to\
   human presence, can raise significant privacy issues: if an end\
   device emits a (encrypted) packet every time someone enters a room in\
   a home, then that traffic is privacy sensitive.  And the more that\

\
RFC 8376                     LPWAN Overview                     May 2018\
\
\
   the existence of that traffic is visible to network entities, the\
   more privacy sensitivities arise.  At this point, it is not clear\
   whether there are workable mitigations for problems like this.  In a\
   more typical network, one would consider defining padding mechanisms\
   and allowing for cover traffic.  In some LPWANs, those mechanisms may\
   not be feasible.  Nonetheless, the privacy challenges do exist and\
   can be real; therefore, some solutions will be needed.  Note that\
   many aspects of solutions in this space may not be visible in IETF\
   specifications but can be, e.g., implementation or deployment\
   specific.\
\
   Another challenge for LPWANs will be how to handle key management and\
   associated protocols.  In a more traditional network (e.g., the Web),\
   servers can "staple" Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)\
   responses in order to allow browsers to check revocation status for\
   presented certificates [RFC6961].  While the stapling approach is\
   likely something that would help in an LPWAN, as it avoids an RTT,\
   certificates and OCSP responses are bulky items and will prove\
   challenging to handle in LPWANs with bounded bandwidth.\

RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   This document introduces an abstract (base) YANG [RFC7950] data model\
   [RFC3444] to represent networks and topologies.  The data model is\
   divided into two parts: The first part of the data model defines a\
   network data model that enables the definition of network\
   hierarchies, or network stacks (i.e., networks that are layered on\
   top of each other) and maintenance of an inventory of nodes contained\
   in a network.  The second part of the data model augments the basic\
   network data model with information to describe topology information.\
   Specifically, it adds the concepts of "links" and\
   "termination points" to describe how nodes in a network are connected\
   to each other.  Moreover, the data model introduces vertical layering\
   relationships between networks that can be augmented to cover both\
   network inventories and network/service topologies.\
\
   Although it would be possible to combine both parts into a single\
   data model, the separation facilitates integration of network\
   topology and network inventory data models, because it allows network\
   inventory information to be augmented separately, and without concern\
   for topology, into the network data model.\
\
   The data model can be augmented to describe the specifics of\
   particular types of networks and topologies.  For example, an\
   augmenting data model can provide network node information with\
   attributes that are specific to a particular network type.  Examples\
   of augmenting models include data models for Layer 2 network\
   topologies; Layer 3 network topologies such as unicast IGP, IS-IS\
   [RFC1195], and OSPF [RFC2328]; traffic engineering (TE) data\
   [RFC3209]; or any of the variety of transport and service topologies.\
   Information specific to particular network types will be captured in\
   separate, technology-specific data models.\
\
   The basic data models introduced in this document are generic in\
   nature and can be applied to many network and service topologies and\
   inventories.  The data models allow applications to operate on an\
   inventory or topology of any network at a generic level, where the\
   specifics of particular inventory/topology types are not required.\
   At the same time, where data specific to a network type comes into\
   play and the data model is augmented, the instantiated data still\
   adheres to the same structure and is represented in a consistent\
   fashion.  This also facilitates the representation of network\
   hierarchies and dependencies between different network components and\
   network types.\
\
   The abstract (base) network YANG module introduced in this document,\
   entitled "ietf-network" (Section 6.1), contains a list of abstract\
   network nodes and defines the concept of "network hierarchy" (network\

\
\
   stack).  The abstract network node can be augmented in inventory and\
   topology data models with inventory-specific and topology-specific\
   attributes.  The network hierarchy (stack) allows any given network\
   to have one or more "supporting networks".  The relationship between\
   the base network data model, the inventory data models, and the\
   topology data models is shown in Figure 1 (dotted lines in the figure\
   denote possible augmentations to models defined in this document).\

\
   The network-topology YANG module introduced in this document,\
   entitled "ietf-network-topology" (Section 6.2), defines a generic\
   topology data model at its most general level of abstraction.  The\
   module defines a topology graph and components from which it is\
   composed: nodes, edges, and termination points.  Nodes (from the\
   "ietf-network" module) represent graph vertices and links represent\
   graph edges.  Nodes also contain termination points that anchor the\
   links.  A network can contain multiple topologies -- for example,\
   topologies at different layers and overlay topologies.  The data\
   model therefore allows relationships between topologies, as well as\
   dependencies between nodes and termination points across topologies,\
   to be captured.  An example of a topology stack is shown in Figure 2.\

\
   Figure 2 shows three topology levels.  At the top, the "Service"\
   topology shows relationships between service entities, such as\
   service functions in a service chain.  The "L3" topology shows\
   network elements at Layer 3 (IP), and the "Optical" topology shows\
   network elements at Layer 1.  Service functions in the "Service"\
   topology are mapped onto network elements in the "L3" topology, which\
   in turn are mapped onto network elements in the "Optical" topology.\
   Two service functions (X1 and X3) are mapped onto a single L3 network\
   element (Y2); this could happen, for example, if two service\
   functions reside in the same Virtual Machine (VM) (or server) and\
   share the same set of network interfaces.  A single "L3" network\
   element (Y2) is mapped onto two "Optical" network elements (Z2 and\
   Z).  This could happen, for example, if a single IP router attaches\
   to multiple Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs) in\
   the optical domain.\

   Figure 3 shows two VPN service topologies (VPN1 and VPN2)\

   mapped onto a subset of nodes from the common L3 topology.\
\
   There are multiple applications for such a data model.  For example,\
   within the context of Interface to the Routing System (I2RS), nodes\
   within the network can use the data model to capture their\
   understanding of the overall network topology and expose it to a\
   network controller.  A network controller can then use the\
   instantiated topology data to compare and reconcile its own view of\
   the network topology with that of the network elements that it\
   controls.  Alternatively, nodes within the network could propagate\
   this understanding to compare and reconcile this understanding either\
   among themselves or with the help of a controller.  Beyond the\
   network element and the immediate context of I2RS itself, a network\
   controller might even use the data model to represent its view of the\
   topology that it controls and expose it to applications north of\
   itself.  Further use cases where the data model can be applied are\
   described in [USECASE-REQS].\

\
\
   In this data model, a network is categorized as either system\
   controlled or not.  If a network is system controlled, then it is\
   automatically populated by the server and represents dynamically\
   learned information that can be read from the operational state\
   datastore.  The data model can also be used to create or modify\
   network topologies that might be associated with an inventory model\
   or with an overlay network.  Such a network is not system controlled;\
   rather, it is configured by a client.\
\
   The data model allows a network to refer to a supporting network,\
   supporting nodes, supporting links, etc.  The data model also allows\
   the layering of a network that is configured on top of a network that\
   is system controlled.  This permits the configuration of overlay\
   networks on top of networks that are discovered.  Specifically, this\
   data model is structured to support being implemented as part of the\
   ephemeral datastore [RFC8342], the requirements for which are defined\
   in Section 3 of [RFC8242].  This allows network topology data that is\
   written, i.e., configured by a client and not system controlled, to\
   refer to dynamically learned data that is controlled by the system,\
   not configured by a client.  A simple use case might involve creating\
   an overlay network that is supported by the dynamically discovered\
   IP-routed network topology.  When an implementation places written\
   data for this data model in the ephemeral datastore, such a network\
   MAY refer to another network that is system controlled.\

RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
   The data model contains a container with a list of networks.  Each\
   network is captured in its own list entry, distinguished via a\
   network-id.\
\
   A network has a certain type, such as L2, L3, OSPF, or IS-IS.  A\
   network can even have multiple types simultaneously.  The type or\
   types are captured underneath the container "network-types".  In this\
   model, it serves merely as an augmentation target; network-specific\
   modules will later introduce new data nodes to represent new network\
   types below this target, i.e., will insert them below "network-types"\
   via YANG augmentation.\
\
   When a network is of a certain type, it will contain a corresponding\
   data node.  Network types SHOULD always be represented using presence\
   containers, not leafs of type "empty".  This allows the\
   representation of hierarchies of network subtypes within the instance\
   information.  For example, an instance of an OSPF network (which, at\
   the same time, is a Layer 3 unicast IGP network) would contain\
   underneath "network-types" another presence container\
   "l3-unicast-igp-network", which in turn would contain a presence\
   container "ospf-network".  Actual examples of this pattern can be\
   found in [RFC8346].\
\
   A network can in turn be part of a hierarchy of networks, building on\
   top of other networks.  Any such networks are captured in the list\
   "supporting-network".  A supporting network is, in effect, an\
   underlay network.\
\
   Furthermore, a network contains an inventory of nodes that are part\
   of the network.  The nodes of a network are captured in their own\
   list.  Each node is identified relative to its containing network by\
   a node-id.\
\
   It should be noted that a node does not exist independently of a\
   network; instead, it is a part of the network that contains it.  In\
   cases where the same device or entity takes part in multiple\
   networks, or at multiple layers of a networking stack, the same\
   device or entity will be represented by multiple nodes, one for each\
   network.  In other words, the node represents an abstraction of the\
   device for the particular network of which it is a part.  To indicate\
   that the same entity or device is part of multiple topologies or\
   networks, it is possible to create one "physical" network with a list\
   of nodes for each of the devices or entities.  This (physical)\
   network -- the nodes (entities) in that network -- can then be\
   referred to as an underlay network and as nodes from the other\
   (logical) networks and nodes, respectively.  Note that the data model\

\
RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
   allows for the definition of more than one underlay network (and\
   node), allowing for simultaneous representation of layered network\
   topologies and service topologies, and their physical instantiation.\
\
   Similar to a network, a node can be supported by other nodes and map\
   onto one or more other nodes in an underlay network.  This is\
   captured in the list "supporting-node".  The resulting hierarchy of\
   nodes also allows for the representation of device stacks, where a\
   node at one level is supported by a set of nodes at an underlying\
   level.  For example:\
\
   o  a "router" node might be supported by a node representing a route\
      processor and separate nodes for various line cards and service\
      modules,\
\
   o  a virtual router might be supported or hosted on a physical device\
      represented by a separate node,\
\
   and so on.\
\
   Network data of a network at a particular layer can come into being\
   in one of two ways: (1) the network data is configured by client\
   applications -- for example, in the case of overlay networks that are\
   configured by an SDN Controller application, or (2) the network data\
   is automatically controlled by the system, in the case of networks\
   that can be discovered.  It is possible for a configured (overlay)\
   network to refer to a (discovered) underlay network.\
\
   The revised datastore architecture [RFC8342] is used to account for\
   those possibilities.  Specifically, for each network, the origin of\
   its data is indicated per the "origin" metadata [RFC7952] annotation\
   (as defined in [RFC8342]) -- "intended" for data that was configured\
   by a client application and "learned" for data that is discovered.\
   Network data that is discovered is automatically populated as part of\
   the operational state datastore.  Network data that is configured is\
   part of the configuration and intended datastores, respectively.\
   Configured network data that is actually in effect is, in addition,\
   reflected in the operational state datastore.  Data in the\
   operational state datastore will always have complete referential\
   integrity.  Should a configured data item (such as a node) have a\
   dangling reference that refers to a non-existing data item (such as a\
   supporting node), the configured data item will automatically be\
   removed from the operational state datastore and thus only appear in\
   the intended datastore.  It will be up to the client application\
   (such as an SDN Controller) to resolve the situation and ensure that\
   the reference to the supporting resources is configured properly.\

4.2.  Base Network Topology Data Model\

   The abstract (base) network topology data model is defined in the\

   (defining how nodes are connected) and termination points (which\
   anchor the links and are contained in nodes).  The structure of the\
   network topology module is shown in Figure 5.  The notation syntax\
   follows the syntax used in [RFC8340].\

\
   A node has a list of termination points that are used to terminate\
   links.  An example of a termination point might be a physical or\
   logical port or, more generally, an interface.\
\
   Like a node, a termination point can in turn be supported by an\
   underlying termination point, contained in the supporting node of the\
   underlay network.\

\
\
   A link is identified by a link-id that uniquely identifies the link\
   within a given topology.  Links are point-to-point and\
   unidirectional.  Accordingly, a link contains a source and a\
   destination.  Both source and destination reference a corresponding\
   node, as well as a termination point on that node.  Similar to a\
   node, a link can map onto one or more links (which are terminated by\
   the corresponding underlay termination points) in an underlay\
   topology.  This is captured in the list "supporting-link".\
\
4.3.  Extending the Data Model\
\
   In order to derive a data model for a specific type of network, the\
   base data model can be extended.  This can be done roughly as\
   follows: a new YANG module for the new network type is introduced.\
   In this module, a number of augmentations are defined against the\
   "ietf-network" and "ietf-network-topology" modules.\
\
   We start with augmentations against the "ietf-network" module.\
   First, a new network type needs to be defined; this is done by\
   defining a presence container that represents the new network type.\
   The new network type is inserted, by means of augmentation, below the\
   network-types container.  Subsequently, data nodes for any node\
   parameters that are specific to a network type are defined and\
   augmented into the node list.  The new data nodes can be defined as\
   conditional ("when") on the presence of the corresponding network\
   type in the containing network.  In cases where there are any\
   requirements or restrictions in terms of network hierarchies, such as\
   when a network of a new network type requires a specific type of\
   underlay network, it is possible to define corresponding constraints\
   as well and augment the supporting-network list accordingly.\
   However, care should be taken to avoid excessive definitions of\
   constraints.\
\
   Subsequently, augmentations are defined against the\
   "ietf-network-topology" module.  Data nodes are defined for link\
   parameters, as well as termination point parameters, that are\
   specific to the new network type.  Those data nodes are inserted via\
   augmentation into the link and termination-point lists, respectively.\
   Again, data nodes can be defined as conditional on the presence of\
   the corresponding network type in the containing network, by adding a\
   corresponding "when" statement.\
\
   It is possible, but not required, to group data nodes for a given\
   network type under a dedicated container.  Doing so introduces\
   additional structure but lengthens data node path names.\

\
\
   In cases where a hierarchy of network types is defined, augmentations\
   can in turn be applied against augmenting modules, with the module of\
   a network whose type is more specific augmenting the module of a\
   network whose type is more general.\
\
4.4.  Discussion and Selected Design Decisions\
\
4.4.1.  Container Structure\
\
   Rather than maintaining lists in separate containers, the data model\
   is kept relatively flat in terms of its containment structure.  Lists\
   of nodes, links, termination points, and supporting nodes; supporting\
   links; and supporting termination points are not kept in separate\
   containers.  Therefore, path identifiers that are used to refer to\
   specific nodes -- in management operations or in specifications of\
   constraints -- can remain relatively compact.  Of course, this means\
   that there is no separate structure in instance information that\
   separates elements of different lists from one another.  Such a\
   structure is semantically not required, but it might provide enhanced\
   "human readability" in some cases.\
\
4.4.2.  Underlay Hierarchies and Mappings\
\
   To minimize assumptions regarding what a particular entity might\
   actually represent, mappings between networks, nodes, links, and\
   termination points are kept strictly generic.  For example, no\
   assumptions are made regarding whether a termination point actually\
   refers to an interface or whether a node refers to a specific\
   "system" or device; the data model at this generic level makes no\
   provisions for these.\
\
   Where additional specifics about mappings between upper and lower\
   layers are required, the information can be captured in augmenting\
   modules.  For example, to express that a termination point in a\
   particular network type maps to an interface, an augmenting module\
   can introduce an augmentation to the termination point.  The\
   augmentation introduces a leaf of type "interface-ref".  That leaf\
   references the corresponding interface [RFC8343].  Similarly, if a\
   node maps to a particular device or network element, an augmenting\
   module can augment the node data with a leaf that references the\
   network element.\

RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
   It is possible for links at one level of a hierarchy to map to\
   multiple links at another level of the hierarchy.  For example, a VPN\
   topology might model VPN tunnels as links.  Where a VPN tunnel maps\
   to a path that is composed of a chain of several links, the link will\
   contain a list of those supporting links.  Likewise, it is possible\
   for a link at one level of a hierarchy to aggregate a bundle of links\
   at another level of the hierarchy.\
\
4.4.3.  Dealing with Changes in Underlay Networks\
\
   It is possible for a network to undergo churn even as other networks\
   are layered on top of it.  When a supporting node, link, or\
   termination point is deleted, the supporting leafrefs in the overlay\
   will be left dangling.  To allow for this possibility, the data model\
   makes use of the "require-instance" construct of YANG 1.1 [RFC7950].\
\
   A dangling leafref of a configured object leaves the corresponding\
   instance in a state in which it lacks referential integrity,\
   effectively rendering it nonoperational.  Any corresponding object\
   instance is therefore removed from the operational state datastore\
   until the situation has been resolved, i.e., until either (1) the\
   supporting object is added to the operational state datastore or\
   (2) the instance is reconfigured to refer to another object that is\
   actually reflected in the operational state datastore.  It will\
   remain part of the intended datastore.\
\
   It is the responsibility of the application maintaining the overlay\
   to deal with the possibility of churn in the underlay network.  When\
   a server receives a request to configure an overlay network, it\
   SHOULD validate whether supporting nodes / links / termination points\
   refer to nodes in the underlay that actually exist, i.e., verify that\
   the nodes are reflected in the operational state datastore.\
   Configuration requests in which supporting nodes / links /\
   termination points refer to objects currently not in existence SHOULD\
   be rejected.  It is the responsibility of the application to update\
   the overlay when a supporting node / link / termination point is\
   deleted at a later point in time.  For this purpose, an application\
   might subscribe to updates when changes to the underlay occur -- for\
   example, using mechanisms defined in [YANG-Push].\
\
4.4.4.  Use of Groupings\
\
   The data model makes use of groupings instead of simply defining data\
   nodes "inline".  This makes it easier to include the corresponding\
   data nodes in notifications, which then do not need to respecify each\
   data node that is to be included.  The trade-off is that it makes the\
   specification of constraints more complex, because constraints\
   involving data nodes outside the grouping need to be specified in\
\

\
RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
   conjunction with a "uses" statement where the grouping is applied.\
   This also means that constraints and XML Path Language (XPath)\
   statements need to be specified in such a way that they navigate\
   "down" first and select entire sets of nodes, as opposed to being\
   able to simply specify them against individual data nodes.\
\
4.4.5.  Cardinality and Directionality of Links\
\
   The topology data model includes links that are point-to-point and\
   unidirectional.  It does not directly support multipoint and\
   bidirectional links.  Although this may appear as a limitation, the\
   decision to do so keeps the data model simple and generic, and it\
   allows it to be very easily subjected to applications that make use\
   of graph algorithms.  Bidirectional connections can be represented\
   through pairs of unidirectional links.  Multipoint networks can be\
   represented through pseudonodes (similar to IS-IS, for example).  By\
   introducing hierarchies of nodes with nodes at one level mapping onto\
   a set of other nodes at another level and by introducing new links\
   for nodes at that level, topologies with connections representing\
   non-point-to-point communication patterns can be represented.\
\
4.4.6.  Multihoming and Link Aggregation\
\
   Links are terminated by a single termination point, not sets of\
   termination points.  Connections involving multihoming or link\
   aggregation schemes need to be represented using multiple point-to-\
   point links and then defining a link at a higher layer that is\
   supported by those individual links.\
\
4.4.7.  Mapping Redundancy\
\
   In a hierarchy of networks, there are nodes mapping to nodes, links\
   mapping to links, and termination points mapping to termination\
   points.  Some of this information is redundant.  Specifically, if the\
   mapping of a link to one or more other links is known and the\
   termination points of each link are known, the mapping information\
   for the termination points can be derived via transitive closure and\
   does not have to be explicitly configured.  Nonetheless, in order to\
   not constrain applications regarding which mappings they want to\
   configure and which should be derived, the data model provides the\
   option to configure this information explicitly.  The data model\
   includes integrity constraints to allow for validating for\
   consistency.\

\
\
4.4.8.  Typing\
\
   A network's network types are represented using a container that\
   contains a data node for each of its network types.  A network can\
   encompass several types of networks simultaneously; hence, a\
   container is used instead of a case construct, with each network type\
   in turn represented by a dedicated presence container.  The reason\
   for not simply using an empty leaf, or (even more simply) even doing\
   away with the network container and just using a leaf-list of\
   "network-type" instead, is to be able to represent "class\
   hierarchies" of network types, with one network type "refining" the\
   other.  Containers specific to a network type are to be defined in\
   the network-specific modules, augmenting the network-types container.\
\
4.4.9.  Representing the Same Device in Multiple Networks\
\
   One common requirement concerns the ability to indicate that the same\
   device can be part of multiple networks and topologies.  However, the\
   data model defines a node as relative to the network that contains\
   it.  The same node cannot be part of multiple topologies.  In many\
   cases, a node will be the abstraction of a particular device in a\
   network.  To reflect that the same device is part of multiple\
   topologies, the following approach might be chosen: a new type of\
   network to represent a "physical" (or "device") network is\
   introduced, with nodes representing devices.  This network forms an\
   underlay network for logical networks above it, with nodes of the\
   logical network mapping onto nodes in the physical network.\
\
   This scenario is depicted in Figure 6.  This figure depicts three\
   networks with two nodes each.  A physical network ("P" in the figure)\
   consists of an inventory of two nodes (D1 and D2), each representing\
   a device.  A second network, X, has a third network, Y, as its\
   underlay.  Both X and Y also have the physical network (P) as their\
   underlay.  X1 has both Y1 and D1 as underlay nodes, while Y1 has D1\
   as its underlay node.  Likewise, X2 has both Y2 and D2 as underlay\
   nodes, while Y2 has D2 as its underlay node.  The fact that X1 and Y1\
   are both instantiated on the same physical node (D1) can be\
   easily seen.\

         Figure 6: Topology Hierarchy Example - Multiple Underlays\
\
   In the case of a physical network, nodes represent physical devices\
   and termination points represent physical ports.  It should be noted\
   that it is also possible to augment the data model for a physical\
   network type, defining augmentations that have nodes reference system\
   information and termination points reference physical interfaces, in\
   order to provide a bridge between network and device models.\
\
4.4.10.  Supporting Client-Configured and System-Controlled Network\
         Topologies\
\
   YANG requires data nodes to be designated as either configuration\
   data ("config true") or operational data ("config false"), but not\
   both, yet it is important to have all network information, including\
   vertical cross-network dependencies, captured in one coherent data\
   model.  In most cases, network topology information about a network\
   is discovered; the topology is considered a property of the network\
   that is reflected in the data model.  That said, certain types of\
   topologies need to also be configurable by an application, e.g., in\
   the case of overlay topologies.\
\
   The YANG data model for network topologies designates all data as\
   "config true".  The distinction between data that is actually\
   configured and data that is in effect, including network data that is\
   discovered, is provided through the datastores introduced as part of\
   the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].\
   Network topology data that is discovered is automatically populated\
   as part of the operational state datastore, i.e., <operational>.  It\
   is "system controlled".  Network topology that is configured is\
   instantiated as part of a configuration datastore, e.g., <intended>.\
   Only when it has actually taken effect will it also be instantiated\
   as part of the operational state datastore, i.e., <operational>.\
\
\

\
RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
   In general, a configured network topology will refer to an underlay\
   topology and include layering information, such as the supporting\
   node(s) underlying a node, supporting link(s) underlying a link, and\
   supporting termination point(s) underlying a termination point.  The\
   supporting objects must be instantiated in the operational state\
   datastore in order for the dependent overlay object to be reflected\
   in the operational state datastore.  Should a configured data item\
   (such as a node) have a dangling reference that refers to a\
   nonexistent data item (such as a supporting node), the configured\
   data item will automatically be removed from <operational> and show\
   up only in <intended>.  It will be up to the client application to\
   resolve the situation and ensure that the reference to the supporting\
   resources is configured properly.\
\
   For each network, the origin of its data is indicated per the\
   "origin" metadata [RFC7952] annotation defined in [RFC8342].  In\
   general, the origin of discovered network data is "learned"; the\
   origin of configured network data is "intended".\
\
4.4.11.  Identifiers of String or URI Type\
\
   The current data model defines identifiers of nodes, networks, links,\
   and termination points as URIs.  Alternatively, they could have been\
   defined as strings.\
\
   The case for strings is that they will be easier to implement.  The\
   reason for choosing URIs is that the topology / node / termination\
   point exists in a larger context; hence, it is useful to be able to\
   correlate identifiers across systems.  Although strings -- being the\
   universal data type -- are easier for human beings, they also muddle\
   things.  What typically happens is that strings have some structure\
   that is magically assigned, and the knowledge of this structure has\
   to be communicated to each system working with the data.  A URI makes\
   the structure explicit and also attaches additional semantics: the\
   URI, unlike a free-form string, can be fed into a URI resolver, which\
   can point to additional resources associated with the URI.  This\
   property is important when the topology data is integrated into a\
   larger and more complex system.\
\
5.  Interactions with Other YANG Modules\
\
   The data model makes use of data types that have been defined in\
   [RFC6991].\
\
   This is a protocol-independent YANG data model with topology\
   information.  It is separate from, and not linked with, data models\
   that are used to configure routing protocols or routing information.\
   This includes, for example, the "ietf-routing" YANG module [RFC8022].\

\
RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
   The data model obeys the requirements for the ephemeral state as\
   specified in [RFC8242].  For ephemeral topology data that is system\
   controlled, the process tasked with maintaining topology information\
   will load information from the routing process (such as OSPF) into\
   the operational state datastore without relying on a configuration\
   datastore.\

8.  Security Considerations\
\
   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data\
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such\
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer\
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure\
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer\
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS\
   [RFC5246].\
\
   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to\
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a\
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol\
   operations and content.\
\
   The network topology and inventory created by these modules reveal\
   information about the structure of networks that could be very\
   helpful to an attacker.  As a privacy consideration, although there\
   is no personally identifiable information defined in these modules,\
   it is possible that some node identifiers may be associated with\
   devices that are in turn associated with specific users.\
\
   The YANG modules define information that can be configurable in\
   certain instances -- for example, in the case of overlay topologies\
   that can be created by client applications.  In such cases, a\
   malicious client could introduce topologies that are undesired.\
   Specifically, a malicious client could attempt to remove or add a\
   node, a link, or a termination point by creating or deleting\
   corresponding elements in node, link, or termination point lists,\
   respectively.  In the case of a topology that is learned, the server\
   will automatically prohibit such misconfiguration attempts.  In the\
   case of a topology that is configured, i.e., whose origin is\
   "intended", the undesired configuration could become effective and be\
   reflected in the operational state datastore, leading to disruption\
   of services provided via this topology.  For example, the topology\
   could be "cut" or could be configured in a suboptimal way, leading to\
   increased consumption of resources in the underlay network due to the\
   routing and bandwidth utilization inefficiencies that would result.\
   Likewise, it could lead to degradation of service levels as well as\
   possible disruption of service.  For those reasons, it is important\
   that the NETCONF access control model be vigorously applied to\
   prevent topology misconfiguration by unauthorized clients.\
\
   There are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG modules that\
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the\
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable\
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)\

\
\
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative\
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes\
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\
\
   In the "ietf-network" module:\
\
   o  network: A malicious client could attempt to remove or add a\
      network in an effort to remove an overlay topology or to create an\
      unauthorized overlay.\
\
   o  supporting network: A malicious client could attempt to disrupt\
      the logical structure of the model, resulting in a lack of overall\
      data integrity and making it more difficult to, for example,\
      troubleshoot problems rooted in the layering of network\
      topologies.\
\
   o  node: A malicious client could attempt to remove or add a node\
      from the network -- for example, in order to sabotage the topology\
      of a network overlay.\
\
   o  supporting node: A malicious client could attempt to change the\
      supporting node in order to sabotage the layering of an overlay.\
\
   In the "ietf-network-topology" module:\
\
   o  link: A malicious client could attempt to remove a link from a\
      topology, add a new link, manipulate the way the link is layered\
      over supporting links, or modify the source or destination of the\
      link.  In each case, the structure of the topology would be\
      sabotaged, and this scenario could, for example, result in an\
      overlay topology that is less than optimal.\
\
   o  termination point: A malicious client could attempt to remove\
      termination points from a node, add "phantom" termination points\
      to a node, or change the layering dependencies of termination\
      points, again in an effort to sabotage the integrity of a topology\
      and potentially disrupt orderly operations of an overlay.\

\
\
Appendix A.  Model Use Cases\
\
A.1.  Fetching Topology from a Network Element\
\
   In its simplest form, topology is learned by a network element (e.g.,\
   a router) through its participation in peering protocols (IS-IS, BGP,\
   etc.).  This learned topology can then be exported (e.g., to a\
   Network Management System) for external utilization.  Typically, any\
   network element in a domain can be queried for its topology and be\
   expected to return the same result.\
\
   In a slightly more complex form, the network element may be a\
   controller.  It could be a network element with satellite or\
   subtended devices hanging off of it, or it could be a controller in\
   the more classical sense -- that is, a special device designated to\
   orchestrate the activities of a number of other devices (e.g., an\
   Optical Controller).  In this case, the controller device is\
   logically a singleton and must be queried distinctly.\
\
   It is worth noting that controllers can be built on top of other\
   controllers to establish a topology incorporating all of the domains\
   within an entire network.\
\
   In all of the cases above, the topology learned by the network\
   element is considered to be operational state data.  That is, the\
   data is accumulated purely by the network element's interactions with\
   other systems and is subject to change dynamically without input or\
   consent.\
\
A.2.  Modifying TE Topology Imported from an Optical Controller\
\
   Consider a scenario where an Optical Controller presents its\
   topology, in abstract TE terms, to a client packet controller.  This\
   customized topology (which gets merged into the client's native\
   topology) contains sufficient information for the path-computing\
   client to select paths across the optical domain according to its\
   policies.  If the client determines (at any given point in time) that\
   this imported topology does not cater exactly to its requirements, it\
   may decide to request modifications to the topology.  Such\
   customization requests may include the addition or deletion of\
   topological elements or the modification of attributes associated\
   with existing topological elements.  From the perspective of the\
   Optical Controller, these requests translate into configuration\
   changes to the exported abstract topology.\
\

RFC 8345         YANG Data Model for Network Topologies       March 2018\
\
\
A.3.  Annotating Topology for Local Computation\
\
   In certain scenarios, the topology learned by a controller needs to\
   be augmented with additional attributes before running a computation\
   algorithm on it.  Consider the case where a path-computation\
   application on the controller needs to take the geographic\
   coordinates of the nodes into account while computing paths on the\
   learned topology.  If the learned topology does not contain these\
   coordinates, then these additional attributes must be configured on\
   the corresponding topological elements.\
\
A.4.  SDN Controller-Based Configuration of Overlays on Top of Underlays\
\
   In this scenario, an SDN Controller (for example, Open Daylight)\
   maintains a view of the topology of the network that it controls\
   based on information that it discovers from the network.  In\
   addition, it provides an application in which it configures and\
   maintains an overlay topology.\
\
   The SDN Controller thus maintains two roles:\
\
   o  It is a client to the network.\
\
   o  It is a server to its own northbound applications and clients,\
      e.g., an Operations Support System (OSS).\
\
   In other words, one system's client (or controller, in this case) may\
   be another system's server (or managed system).\
\
   In this scenario, the SDN Controller maintains a consolidated data\
   model of multiple layers of topology.  This includes the lower layers\
   of the network topology, built from information that is discovered\
   from the network.  It also includes upper layers of topology overlay,\
   configurable by the controller's client, i.e., the OSS.  To the OSS,\
   the lower topology layers constitute "read-only" information.  The\
   upper topology layers need to be read-writable.\
\
Appendix B.  Companion YANG Data Models for Implementations Not\
             Compliant with NMDA\
\
   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be used in\
   conjunction with implementations that support the Network Management\
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as defined in [RFC8342].  In order to\
   allow implementations to use the data model even in cases when NMDA\
   is not supported, the following two companion modules --\
   "ietf-network-state" and "ietf-network-topology-state" -- are\
   defined; they represent the operational state of networks and network\
   topologies, respectively.  These modules mirror the "ietf-network"\

\
\
   and "ietf-network-topology" modules (defined in Sections 6.1 and 6.2\
   of this document); however, in the case of these modules, all data\
   nodes are non-configurable.  They represent state that comes into\
   being by either (1) learning topology information from the network or\
   (2) applying configuration from the mirrored modules.\
\
   The "ietf-network-state" and "ietf-network-topology-state" companion\
   modules are redundant and SHOULD NOT be supported by implementations\
   that support NMDA; therefore, we define these modules in\
   Appendices B.1 and B.2 (below) instead of the main body of this\
   document.\

    description\
      "This module defines a common base data model for network\
       topology state, representing topology that either (1) is learned\
       or (2) results from applying topology that has been configured\
       per the 'ietf-network-topology' data model, mirroring the\
       corresponding data nodes in this data model.  It augments the\
       base network state data model with links to connect nodes, as\
       well as termination points to terminate links on nodes.\
\
       The data model mirrors 'ietf-network-topology' but contains only\
       read-only state data.  The data model is not needed when the\
       underlying implementation infrastructure supports the Network\
       Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).\

Appendix C.  An Example\
\
   This section contains an example of an instance data tree in JSON\
   encoding [RFC7951].  The example instantiates "ietf-network-topology"\
   (and "ietf-network", which "ietf-network-topology" augments) for the\
   topology depicted in Figure 7.  There are three nodes: D1, D2, and\
   D3.  D1 has three termination points (1-0-1, 1-2-1, and 1-3-1).\
   D2 has three termination points as well (2-1-1, 2-0-1, and 2-3-1).\
   D3 has two termination points (3-1-1 and 3-2-1).  In addition, there\
   are six links, two between each pair of nodes with one going in each\
   direction.\

               Network Configuration Access Control Model\
\
Abstract\
\
   The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with\
   the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) or the RESTCONF protocol\
   requires a structured and secure operating environment that promotes\
   human usability and multi-vendor interoperability.  There is a need\
   for standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol\
   access for particular users to a preconfigured subset of all\
   available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.  This\
   document defines such an access control model.\
\
   This document obsoletes RFC 6536.\
\

1.  Introduction\
\
   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and the RESTCONF\
   protocol do not provide any standard mechanisms to restrict the\
   protocol operations and content that each user is authorized to\
   access.\
\
   There is a need for interoperable management of the controlled access\
   to administrator-selected portions of the available NETCONF or\
   RESTCONF content within a particular server.\
\
   This document addresses access control mechanisms for the Operations\
   and Content layers of NETCONF, as defined in [RFC6241]; and RESTCONF,\
   as defined in [RFC8040].  It contains three main sections:\
\
   1.  Access Control Design Objectives\
\
   2.  NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM)\
\
   3.  YANG Data Model (ietf-netconf-acm.yang)\
\
   YANG version 1.1 [RFC7950] adds two new constructs that need special\
   access control handling.  The "action" statement is similar to the\
   "rpc" statement, except that it is located within a data node.  The\
   "notification" statement can also be located within a data node.\
\
1.1.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] and are not redefined\
   here:\
\
   o  datastore\
\
   o  configuration datastore\
\
   o  conventional configuration datastore\
\
   o  candidate configuration datastore\
\
   o  running configuration datastore\
\
   o  startup configuration datastore\

RFC 8341                          NACM                        March 2018\
\
\
   access control rule:  The criterion used to determine if a particular\
      access operation will be permitted or denied.\
\
   access operation:  How a request attempts to access a conceptual\
      object.  One of "none", "read", "create", "delete", "update", or\
      "execute".\
\
   data node hierarchy:  The hierarchy of data nodes that identifies the\
      specific "action" or "notification" node in the datastore.\
\
   recovery session:  A special administrative session that is given\
      unlimited NETCONF access and is exempt from all access control\
      enforcement.  The mechanism or mechanisms used by a server to\
      control and identify whether or not a session is a recovery\
      session are implementation specific and are outside the scope of\
      this document.\
\
   write access:  A shorthand for the "create", "delete", and "update"\
      access operations.\
\
1.2.  Changes since RFC 6536\
\
   The NACM procedures and data model have been updated to support new\
   data modeling capabilities in version 1.1 of the YANG data modeling\
   language.  The "action" and "notification" statements can be used\
   within data nodes to define data-model-specific operations and\
   notifications.\
\
   An important use case for these new YANG statements is the increased\
   access control granularity that can be achieved over top-level "rpc"\
   and "notification" statements.  The new "action" and "notification"\
   statements are used within data nodes, and access to the action or\
   notification can be restricted to specific instances of these data\
   nodes.\
\
   Support for the RESTCONF protocol has been added.  The RESTCONF\
   operations are similar to the NETCONF operations, so a simple mapping\
   to the existing NACM procedures and data model is possible.\
\
   The data node access behavior for path matches has been clarified to\
   also include matching descendant nodes of the specified path.\
\
   The <edit-config> operation access rights behavior has been clarified\
   to indicate that write access is not required for data nodes that are\
   implicitly modified through side effects (such as the evaluation of\
   YANG when-stmts, or data nodes implicitly deleted when creating a\
   data node under a different branch under a YANG choice-stmt).\

\
\
   The Security Considerations section has been updated to comply with\
   the "YANG module security guidelines" [YANG-SEC].  Note that the YANG\
   module in this document does not define any RPC operations.\
\
2.  Access Control Design Objectives\
\
   This section documents the design objectives for the NETCONF access\
   control model presented in Section 3.\
\
2.1.  Access Control Points\
\
   NETCONF allows server implementers to add new custom protocol\
   operations, and the YANG data modeling language supports this\
   feature.  These operations can be defined in standard or proprietary\
   YANG modules.\
\
   It is not possible to design an ACM for NETCONF that only focuses on\
   a static set of standard protocol operations defined by NETCONF\
   itself, like some other protocols.  Since few assumptions can be made\
   about an arbitrary protocol operation, the NETCONF architectural\
   server components need to be protected at three conceptual control\
   points.\
\
   These access control points, described in Figure 1, are as follows:\
\
   protocol operation:  Permission to invoke specific protocol\
      operations.\
\
   datastore:  Permission to read and/or alter specific data nodes\
      within any datastore.\
\
   notification:  Permission to receive specific notification event\
      types.\
\
                 +-------------+                 +-------------+\
    client       |  protocol   |                 |  data node  |\
    request -->  |  operation  | ------------->  |   access    |\
                 |  allowed?   |   datastore     |  allowed?   |\
                 +-------------+   or state      +-------------+\
                                   data access\
\
\
                 +----------------+\
                 |  notification  |\
    event -->    |  allowed?      |\
                 +----------------+\

RFC 8341                          NACM                        March 2018\
\
\
2.2.  Simplicity\
\
   There is concern that a complicated ACM will not be widely deployed\
   because it is too hard to use.  Configuration of the access control\
   system needs to be as simple as possible.  Simple and common tasks\
   need to be easy to configure and require little expertise or\
   domain-specific knowledge.  Complex tasks are possible using\
   additional mechanisms that may require additional expertise.\
\
   A single set of access control rules ought to be able to control all\
   types of NETCONF protocol operation invocation, all datastore access,\
   and all notification events.\
\
   Access control ought to be defined with a small and familiar set of\
   permissions, while still allowing full control of datastore access.\
\
2.3.  Procedural Interface\
\
   NETCONF uses a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model and an extensible\
   set of protocol operations.  Access control for any possible protocol\
   operation is necessary.\
\
2.4.  Datastore Access\
\
   It is necessary to control access to specific nodes and subtrees\
   within the datastore, regardless of which protocol operation --\
   standard or proprietary -- was used to access the datastore.\
\
2.5.  Users and Groups\
\
   It is necessary that access control rules for a single user or a\
   configurable group of users can be configured.\
\
   The ACM needs to support the concept of administrative groups, to\
   support the well-established distinction between a root account and\
   other types of less-privileged conceptual user accounts.  These\
   groups need to be configurable by the administrator.\
\
   It is necessary that the user-to-group mapping can be delegated to a\
   central server, such as a RADIUS server [RFC2865] [RFC5607].  Since\
   authentication is performed by the transport layer and RADIUS\
   performs authentication and service authorization at the same time,\
   the underlying transport protocol needs to be able to report a set of\
   group names associated with the user to the server.  It is necessary\
   that the administrator can disable the usage of these group names\
   within the ACM.\

\
\
2.6.  Maintenance\
\
   It ought to be possible to disable part or all of the access control\
   model enforcement procedures without deleting any access control\
   rules.\
\
2.7.  Configuration Capabilities\
\
   Suitable configuration and monitoring mechanisms are needed to allow\
   an administrator to easily manage all aspects of the ACM's behavior.\
   A standard data model, suitable for use with the <edit-config>\
   protocol operation, needs to be available for this purpose.\
\
   Access control rules to restrict access operations on specific\
   subtrees within the configuration datastore need to be supported.\
\
2.8.  Identifying Security-Sensitive Content\
\
   One of the most important aspects of the data model documentation,\
   and one of the biggest concerns during deployment, is the\
   identification of security-sensitive content.  This applies to\
   protocol operations in NETCONF, not just data and notifications.\
\
   It is mandatory for security-sensitive objects to be documented in\
   the Security Considerations section of an RFC.  This is nice, but it\
   is not good enough, for the following reasons:\
\
   o  This documentation-only approach forces administrators to study\
      the RFC and determine if there are any potential security risks\
      introduced by a new data model.\
\
   o  If any security risks are identified, then the administrator must\
      study some more RFC text and determine how to mitigate the\
      security risk(s).\
\
   o  The ACM on each server must be configured to mitigate the security\
      risks, e.g., require privileged access to read or write the\
      specific data identified in the Security Considerations section.\
\
   o  If the ACM is not preconfigured, then there will be a time window\
      of vulnerability after the new data model is loaded and before the\
      new access control rules for that data model are configured,\
      enabled, and debugged.\
\
   Often, the administrator just wants to disable default access to the\
   secure content so that no inadvertent or malicious changes can be\
   made to the server.  This allows the default rules to be more\
   lenient, without significantly increasing the security risk.\

\
\
   A data model designer needs to be able to use machine-readable\
   statements to identify content that needs to be protected by default.\
   This will allow client and server tools to automatically identify\
   data-model-specific security risks, by denying access to sensitive\
   data unless the user is explicitly authorized to perform the\
   requested access operation.\
\
3.  NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM)\
\
3.1.  Overview\
\
   This section provides a high-level overview of the access control\
   model structure.  It describes the NETCONF protocol message\
   processing model and the conceptual access control requirements\
   within that model.\
\
3.1.1.  Features\
\
   The NACM data model provides the following features:\
\
   o  Independent control of RPC, action, data, and notification access\
      is provided.\
\
   o  The concept of an emergency recovery session is supported, but\
      configuration of the server for this purpose is beyond the scope\
      of this document.  An emergency recovery session will bypass all\
      access control enforcement, in order to allow it to initialize or\
      repair the NACM configuration.\
\
   o  A simple and familiar set of datastore permissions is used.\
\
   o  Support for YANG security tagging (e.g., a\
      "nacm:default-deny-write" statement) allows default security modes\
      to automatically exclude sensitive data.\
\
   o  Separate default access modes for read, write, and execute\
      permissions are provided.\
\
   o  Access control rules are applied to configurable groups of users.\
\
   o  The access control enforcement procedures can be disabled during\
      operation, without deleting any access control rules, in order to\
      debug operational problems.\

RFC 8341                          NACM                        March 2018\
\
\
   o  The number of denied protocol operation requests and denied\
      datastore write requests can be monitored by the client.\
\
   o  Simple unconstrained YANG instance-identifiers are used to\
      configure access control rules for specific data nodes.\
\
3.1.2.  External Dependencies\
\
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] are used for network\
   management purposes within this document.\
\
   The YANG data modeling language [RFC7950] is used to define the data\
   models for use with NETCONF or RESTCONF.  YANG is also used to define\
   the data model in this document.\
\
3.1.3.  Message Processing Model\
\
   The following diagram shows the conceptual message flow model,\
   including the points at which access control is applied during\
   NETCONF message processing.\
\
   RESTCONF operations are mapped to the access control model based on\
   the HTTP method and resource class used in the operation.  For\
   example, a POST method on a data resource is considered "write data\
   node" access, but a POST method on an operation resource is\
   considered "operation" access.\
\
   The new "pre-read data node acc. ctl" boxes in the diagram below\
   refer to group read access as it relates to data node ancestors of an\
   action or notification.  As an example, if an action is defined as\
   /interfaces/interface/reset-interface, the group must be authorized\
   to (1) read /interfaces and /interfaces/interface and (2) execute on\
   /interfaces/interface/reset-interface.\

\
\
   The following high-level sequence of conceptual processing steps is\
   executed for each received <rpc> message, if access control\
   enforcement is enabled:\
\
   o  For each active session, access control is applied individually to\
      all <rpc> messages (except <close-session>) received by the\
      server, unless the session is identified as a recovery session.\
\
   o  If the <action> operation defined in [RFC7950] is invoked, then\
      read access is required for all instances in the hierarchy of data\
      nodes that identifies the specific action in the datastore, and\
      execute access is required for the action node.  If the user is\
      not authorized to read all the specified data nodes and execute\
      the action, then the request is rejected with an "access-denied"\
      error.\
\
   o  Otherwise, if the user is not authorized to execute the specified\
      protocol operation, then the request is rejected with an\
      "access-denied" error.\
\
   o  If a datastore is accessed by the protocol operation, then the\
      server checks to see if the client is authorized to access the\
      nodes in the datastore.  If the user is not authorized to perform\
      the requested access operation on the requested data, then the\
      request is rejected with an "access-denied" error.\
\
   The following sequence of conceptual processing steps is executed for\
   each generated notification event, if access control enforcement is\
   enabled:\
\
   o  Server instrumentation generates a notification for a particular\
      subscription.\
\
   o  If the "notification" statement is specified within a data\
      subtree, as specified in [RFC7950], then read access is required\
      for all instances in the hierarchy of data nodes that identifies\
      the specific notification in the datastore, and read access is\
      required for the notification node.  If the user is not authorized\
      to read all the specified data nodes and the notification node,\
      then the notification is dropped for that subscription.\
\
   o  If the "notification" statement is a top-level statement, the\
      notification access control enforcer checks the notification event\
      type, and if it is one that the user is not authorized to read,\
      then the notification is dropped for that subscription.\

\
\
3.2.  Datastore Access\
\
   The same access control rules apply to all datastores that support\
   the NACM -- for example, the candidate configuration datastore or the\
   running configuration datastore.\
\
   All conventional configuration datastores and the operational state\
   datastore are controlled by the NACM.  Local files, remote files, or\
   datastores accessed via the <url> parameter are not controlled by\
   the NACM.\
\
3.2.1.  Mapping New Datastores to NACM\
\
   It is possible that new datastores will be defined over time for use\
   with NETCONF.  The NACM MAY be applied to other datastores that have\
   similar access rights as defined in the NACM.  To apply the NACM to a\
   new datastore, the new datastore specification needs to define how it\
   maps to the NACM CRUDX (Create, Read, Update, Delete, eXec) access\
   rights.  It is possible that only a subset of the NACM access rights\
   would be applicable.  For example, only retrieval access control\
   would be needed for a read-only datastore.  Operations and access\
   rights not supported by the NACM CRUDX model are outside the scope of\
   this document.  A datastore does not need to use the NACM, e.g., the\
   datastore specification defines something else or does not use access\
   control.\
\
3.2.2.  Access Rights\
\
   A small set of hard-wired datastore access rights is needed to\
   control access to all possible protocol operations, including vendor\
   extensions to the standard protocol operation set.\
\
   The CRUDX model can support all protocol operations:\
\
   o  Create: allows the client to add a new data node instance to a\
      datastore.\
\
   o  Read: allows the client to read a data node instance from a\
      datastore or receive the notification event type.\
\
   o  Update: allows the client to update an existing data node instance\
      in a datastore.\
\
   o  Delete: allows the client to delete a data node instance from a\
      datastore.\
\
   o  eXec: allows the client to execute the operation.\

\
\
3.2.3.  RESTCONF Methods\
\
   The RESTCONF protocol utilizes HTTP methods to perform datastore\
   operations, similar to NETCONF.  The NACM procedures were originally\
   written for NETCONF protocol operations, so the RESTCONF methods are\
   mapped to NETCONF operations for the purpose of access control\
   processing.  The enforcement procedures described within this\
   document apply to both protocols unless explicitly stated otherwise.\
\
   The request URI needs to be considered when processing RESTCONF\
   requests on data resources:\
\
   o  For HEAD and GET requests, any data nodes that are ancestor nodes\
      of the target resource are considered to be part of the retrieval\
      request for access control purposes.\
\
   o  For PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests, any data nodes that are\
      ancestor nodes of the target resource are not considered to be\
      part of the edit request for access control purposes.  The access\
      operation for these nodes is considered to be "none".  The edit\
      begins at the target resource.\
\
   o  For POST requests on data resources, any data nodes that are\
      specified in the request URI, including the target resource, are\
      not considered to be part of the edit request for access control\
      purposes.  The access operation for these nodes is considered to\
      be "none".  The edit begins at a child node of the target\
      resource, specified in the message body.\

\
   Not all RESTCONF methods are subject to access control.  The\
   following table specifies how each method is mapped to NETCONF\
   protocol operations.  The value "none" indicates that the NACM is not\
   applied at all to the specific RESTCONF method.\

               Table 1: Mapping RESTCONF Methods to NETCONF\
\
3.2.4.  <get> and <get-config> Operations\
\
   The NACM access rights are not directly coupled to the <get> and\
   <get-config> protocol operations but apply to all <rpc> operations\
   that would result in a "read" access operation to the target\
   datastore.  This section describes how these access rights apply to\
   the specific access operations supported by the <get> and\
   <get-config> protocol operations.\
\
   Data nodes to which the client does not have read access are silently\
   omitted, along with any descendants, from the <rpc-reply> message.\
   This is done to allow NETCONF filters for <get> and <get-config> to\
   function properly, instead of causing an "access-denied" error\
   because the filter criteria would otherwise include unauthorized read\
   access to some data nodes.  For NETCONF filtering purposes, the\
   selection criteria are applied to the subset of nodes that the user\
   is authorized to read, not the entire datastore.\
\
3.2.5.  <edit-config> Operation\
\
   The NACM access rights are not directly coupled to the <edit-config>\
   "operation" attribute, although they are similar.  Instead, a NACM\
   access right applies to all protocol operations that would result in\
   a particular access operation to the target datastore.  This section\
   describes how these access rights apply to the specific access\
   operations supported by the <edit-config> protocol operation.\

RFC 8341                          NACM                        March 2018\
\
\
   If the effective access operation is "none" (i.e.,\
   default-operation="none") for a particular data node, then no access\
   control is applied to that data node.  This is required to allow\
   access to a subtree within a larger data structure.  For example, a\
   user may be authorized to create a new "/interfaces/interface" list\
   entry but not be authorized to create or delete its parent container\
   ("/interfaces").  If the "/interfaces" container already exists in\
   the target datastore, then the effective operation will be "none" for\
   the "/interfaces" node if an "/interfaces/interface" list entry is\
   edited.\
\
   If the protocol operation would result in the creation of a datastore\
   node and the user does not have "create" access permission for that\
   node, the protocol operation is rejected with an "access-denied"\
   error.\
\
   If the protocol operation would result in the deletion of a datastore\
   node and the user does not have "delete" access permission for that\
   node, the protocol operation is rejected with an "access-denied"\
   error.\
\
   If the protocol operation would result in the modification of a\
   datastore node and the user does not have "update" access permission\
   for that node, the protocol operation is rejected with an\
   "access-denied" error.\
\
   A "merge" or "replace" <edit-config> operation may include data nodes\
   that do not alter portions of the existing datastore.  For example, a\
   container or list node may be present for naming purposes but does\
   not actually alter the corresponding datastore node.  These unaltered\
   data nodes are ignored by the server and do not require any access\
   rights by the client.\
\
   A "merge" <edit-config> operation may include data nodes but not\
   include particular child data nodes that are present in the\
   datastore.  These missing data nodes within the scope of a "merge"\
   <edit-config> operation are ignored by the server and do not require\
   any access rights by the client.\
\
   The contents of specific restricted datastore nodes MUST NOT be\
   exposed in any <rpc-error> elements within the reply.\
\
   An <edit-config> operation may cause data nodes to be implicitly\
   created or deleted as an implicit side effect of a requested\
   operation.  For example, a YANG when-stmt expression may evaluate to\
   a different result, causing data nodes to be deleted, or created with\
   default values; or if a data node is created under one branch of a\
   YANG choice-stmt, then all data nodes under the other branches are\

\
\
   implicitly removed.  No NACM access rights are required on any data\
   nodes that are implicitly changed as a side effect of another allowed\
   operation.\
\
3.2.6.  <copy-config> Operation\
\
   Access control for the <copy-config> protocol operation requires\
   special consideration because the administrator may be replacing the\
   entire target datastore.\
\
   If the source of the <copy-config> protocol operation is the running\
   configuration datastore and the target is the startup configuration\
   datastore, the client is only required to have permission to execute\
   the <copy-config> protocol operation.\
\
   Otherwise:\
\
   o  If the source of the <copy-config> operation is a datastore, then\
      data nodes to which the client does not have read access are\
      silently omitted.\
\
   o  If the target of the <copy-config> operation is a datastore, the\
      client needs access to the modified nodes.  Specifically:\
\
      *  If the protocol operation would result in the creation of a\
         datastore node and the user does not have "create" access\
         permission for that node, the protocol operation is rejected\
         with an "access-denied" error.\
\
      *  If the protocol operation would result in the deletion of a\
         datastore node and the user does not have "delete" access\
         permission for that node, the protocol operation is rejected\
         with an "access-denied" error.\
\
      *  If the protocol operation would result in the modification of a\
         datastore node and the user does not have "update" access\
         permission for that node, the protocol operation is rejected\
         with an "access-denied" error.\
\
3.2.7.  <delete-config> Operation\
\
   Access to the <delete-config> protocol operation is denied by\
   default.  The "exec-default" leaf does not apply to this protocol\
   operation.  Access control rules must be explicitly configured to\
   allow invocation by a non-recovery session.\

\
\
3.2.8.  <commit> Operation\
\
   The server MUST determine the exact nodes in the running\
   configuration datastore that are actually different and only check\
   "create", "update", and "delete" access permissions for this set of\
   nodes, which could be empty.\
\
   For example, if a session can read the entire datastore but only\
   change one leaf, that session needs to be able to edit and commit\
   that one leaf.\
\
3.2.9.  <discard-changes> Operation\
\
   The client is only required to have permission to execute the\
   <discard-changes> protocol operation.  No datastore permissions are\
   needed.\
\
3.2.10.  <kill-session> Operation\
\
   The <kill-session> operation does not directly alter a datastore.\
   However, it allows one session to disrupt another session that is\
   editing a datastore.\
\
   Access to the <kill-session> protocol operation is denied by default.\
   The "exec-default" leaf does not apply to this protocol operation.\
   Access control rules must be explicitly configured to allow\
   invocation by a non-recovery session.\
\
3.3.  Model Components\
\
   This section defines the conceptual components related to the access\
   control model.\
\
3.3.1.  Users\
\
   A "user" is the conceptual entity that is associated with the access\
   permissions granted to a particular session.  A user is identified by\
   a string that is unique within the server.\
\
   As described in [RFC6241], the username string is derived from the\
   transport layer during session establishment.  If the transport layer\
   cannot authenticate the user, the session is terminated.\

\
\
3.3.2.  Groups\
\
   Access to a specific NETCONF protocol operation is granted to a\
   session.  The session is associated with a group (i.e., not with\
   a user).\
\
   A group is identified by its name.  All group names are unique within\
   the server.\
\
   Access control is applied at the level of groups.  A group contains\
   zero or more group members.\
\
   A group member is identified by a username string.\
\
   The same user can be a member of multiple groups.\
\
3.3.3.  Emergency Recovery Session\
\
   The server MAY support a recovery session mechanism, which will\
   bypass all access control enforcement.  This is useful for\
   restricting initial access and repairing a broken access control\
   configuration.\
\
3.3.4.  Global Enforcement Controls\
\
   There are five global controls that are used to help control how\
   access control is enforced.\
\
3.3.4.1.  enable-nacm Switch\
\
   A global "enable-nacm" on/off switch is provided to enable or disable\
   all access control enforcement.  When this global switch is set to\
   "true", all requests are checked against the access control rules and\
   only permitted if configured to allow the specific access request.\
   When this global switch is set to "false", all access requests are\
   permitted.\
\
3.3.4.2.  read-default Switch\
\
   An on/off "read-default" switch is provided to enable or disable\
   default access to receive data in replies and notifications.  When\
   the "enable-nacm" global switch is set to "true", this global switch\
   is relevant if no matching access control rule is found to explicitly\
   permit or deny read access to the requested datastore data or\
   notification event type.\

\
\
   When this global switch is set to "permit" and no matching access\
   control rule is found for the datastore read or notification event\
   requested, access is permitted.\
\
   When this global switch is set to "deny" and no matching access\
   control rule is found for the datastore read or notification event\
   requested, access is denied.  This means that the requested data is\
   not sent to the client.  See step 11 in Section 3.4.5 for details.\
\
3.3.4.3.  write-default Switch\
\
   An on/off "write-default" switch is provided to enable or disable\
   default access to alter configuration data.  When the "enable-nacm"\
   global switch is set to "true", this global switch is relevant if no\
   matching access control rule is found to explicitly permit or deny\
   write access to the requested datastore data.\
\
   When this global switch is set to "permit" and no matching access\
   control rule is found for the datastore write requested, access is\
   permitted.\
\
   When this global switch is set to "deny" and no matching access\
   control rule is found for the datastore write requested, access is\
   denied.  See step 12 in Section 3.4.5 for details.\
\
3.3.4.4.  exec-default Switch\
\
   An on/off "exec-default" switch is provided to enable or disable\
   default access to execute protocol operations.  When the\
   "enable-nacm" global switch is set to "true", this global switch is\
   relevant if no matching access control rule is found to explicitly\
   permit or deny access to the requested NETCONF protocol operation.\
\
   When this global switch is set to "permit" and no matching access\
   control rule is found for the NETCONF protocol operation requested,\
   access is permitted.\
\
   When this global switch is set to "deny" and no matching access\
   control rule is found for the NETCONF protocol operation requested,\
   access is denied.  See step 12 in Section 3.4.4 and step 13 in\
   Section 3.4.5 for details.\

\
\
3.3.4.5.  enable-external-groups Switch\
\
   When this global switch is set to "true", the group names reported by\
   the transport layer for a session are used together with the locally\
   configured group names to determine the access control rules for the\
   session.\
\
   When this switch is set to "false", the group names reported by the\
   transport layer are ignored by the NACM.\
\
3.3.5.  Access Control Rules\
\
   There are four types of rules available in the NACM:\
\
   module rule:  controls access for definitions in a specific YANG\
      module, identified by its name.\
\
   protocol operation rule:  controls access for a specific protocol\
      operation, identified by its YANG module and name.\
\
   data node rule:  controls access for a specific data node and its\
      descendants, identified by its path location within the conceptual\
      XML document for the data node.\
\
   notification rule:  controls access for a specific notification event\
      type, identified by its YANG module and name.\
\
3.4.  Access Control Enforcement Procedures\
\
   There are six separate phases that need to be addressed, four of\
   which are related to the NETCONF message processing model\
   (Section 3.1.3):\
\
   1.  Initial operation\
\
   2.  Session establishment\
\
   3.  "access-denied" error handling\
\
   4.  Incoming RPC message validation\
\
   5.  Data node access validation\
\
   6.  Outgoing <notification> authorization\
\
   In addition, the initial startup mode for a NETCONF server, session\
   establishment, and "access-denied" error-handling procedures also\
   need to be considered.\

RFC 8341                          NACM                        March 2018\
\
\
   The server MUST use the access control rules in effect at the time it\
   starts processing the message.  The same access control rules MUST\
   stay in effect for the processing of the entire message.\
\
3.4.1.  Initial Operation\
\
   Upon the very first startup of the NETCONF server, the access control\
   configuration will probably not be present.  If it isn't, a server\
   MUST NOT allow any write access to any session role except a recovery\
   session.\
\
   Access rules are enforced any time a request is initiated from a user\
   session.  Access control is not enforced for server-initiated access\
   requests, such as the initial load of the running configuration\
   datastore, during bootup.\
\
3.4.2.  Session Establishment\
\
   The access control model applies specifically to the well-formed XML\
   content transferred between a client and a server after session\
   establishment has been completed and after the <hello> exchange has\
   been successfully completed.\
\
   Once session establishment is completed and a user has been\
   authenticated, the transport layer reports the username and a\
   possibly empty set of group names associated with the user to the\
   NETCONF server.  The NETCONF server will enforce the access control\
   rules, based on the supplied username, group names, and the\
   configuration data stored on the server.\
\
3.4.3.  "access-denied" Error Handling\
\
   The "access-denied" error-tag is generated when the access control\
   system denies access to either a request to invoke a protocol\
   operation or a request to perform a particular access operation on\
   the configuration datastore.\
\
   A server MUST NOT include any information the client is not allowed\
   to read in any <error-info> elements within the <rpc-error> response.\

   control processing model for incoming NETCONF <rpc> messages within a\

   Access control begins with the message dispatcher.\
\
   After the server validates the <rpc> element and determines the\
   namespace URI and the element name of the protocol operation being\
   requested, the server verifies that the user is authorized to invoke\
   the protocol operation.\

\
\
   The server MUST separately authorize every protocol operation by\
   following these steps:\
\
   1.   If the "enable-nacm" leaf is set to "false", then the protocol\
        operation is permitted.\
\
   2.   If the requesting session is identified as a recovery session,\
        then the protocol operation is permitted.\
\
   3.   If the requested operation is the NETCONF <close-session>\
        protocol operation, then the protocol operation is permitted.\
\
   4.   Check all the "group" entries to see if any of them contain a\
        "user-name" entry that equals the username for the session\
        making the request.  If the "enable-external-groups" leaf is\
        "true", add to these groups the set of groups provided by the\
        transport layer.\
\
   5.   If no groups are found, continue with step 10.\
\
   6.   Process all rule-list entries, in the order they appear in the\
        configuration.  If a rule-list's "group" leaf-list does not\
        match any of the user's groups, proceed to the next rule-list\
        entry.\
\
   7.   For each rule-list entry found, process all rules, in order,\
        until a rule that matches the requested access operation is\
        found.  A rule matches if all of the following criteria are met:\
\
        *  The rule's "module-name" leaf is "*" or equals the name of\
           the YANG module where the protocol operation is defined.\
\
        *  Either (1) the rule does not have a "rule-type" defined or\
           (2) the "rule-type" is "protocol-operation" and the\
           "rpc-name" is "*" or equals the name of the requested\
           protocol operation.\
\
        *  The rule's "access-operations" leaf has the "exec" bit set or\
           has the special value "*".\
\
   8.   If a matching rule is found, then the "action" leaf is checked.\
        If it is equal to "permit", then the protocol operation is\
        permitted; otherwise, it is denied.\
\
   9.   At this point, no matching rule was found in any rule-list\
        entry.\

\
\
   10.  If the requested protocol operation is defined in a YANG module\
        advertised in the server capabilities and the "rpc" statement\
        contains a "nacm:default-deny-all" statement, then the protocol\
        operation is denied.\
\
   11.  If the requested protocol operation is the NETCONF\
        <kill-session> or <delete-config>, then the protocol operation\
        is denied.\
\
   12.  If the "exec-default" leaf is set to "permit", then permit the\
        protocol operation; otherwise, deny the request.\
\
   If the user is not authorized to invoke the protocol operation, then\
   an <rpc-error> is generated with the following information:\
\
   error-tag:  access-denied\
\
   error-path:  Identifies the requested protocol operation.  The\
      following example represents the <edit-config> protocol operation\
      in the NETCONF base namespace:\
\
         <error-path\
           xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">\
             /nc:rpc/nc:edit-config\
         </error-path>\
\
   If a datastore is accessed, either directly or as a side effect of\
   the protocol operation, then the server MUST intercept the access\
   operation and make sure that the user is authorized to perform the\
   requested access operation on the specified data, as defined in\
   Section 3.4.5.\
\
3.4.5.  Data Node Access Validation\
\
   If (1) a data node within a datastore is accessed or (2) an action or\
   notification is tied to a data node, then the server MUST ensure that\
   the user is authorized to perform the requested "read", "create",\
   "update", "delete", or "execute" access operation on the specified\
   data node.\
\
   If an action is requested to be executed, the server MUST ensure that\
   the user is authorized to perform the "execute" access operation on\
   the requested action.\
\
   If a notification tied to a data node is generated, the server MUST\
   ensure that the user is authorized to perform the "read" access\
   operation on the requested notification.\

\
\
   The data node access request is authorized by following these steps:\
\
   1.   If the "enable-nacm" leaf is set to "false", then the access\
        operation is permitted.\
\
   2.   If the requesting session is identified as a recovery session,\
        then the access operation is permitted.\
\
   3.   Check all the "group" entries to see if any of them contain a\
        "user-name" entry that equals the username for the session\
        making the request.  If the "enable-external-groups" leaf is\
        "true", add to these groups the set of groups provided by the\
        transport layer.\
\
   4.   If no groups are found, continue with step 9.\
\
   5.   Process all rule-list entries, in the order they appear in the\
        configuration.  If a rule-list's "group" leaf-list does not\
        match any of the user's groups, proceed to the next rule-list\
        entry.\
\
   6.   For each rule-list entry found, process all rules, in order,\
        until a rule that matches the requested access operation is\
        found.  A rule matches if all of the following criteria are met:\
\
        *  The rule's "module-name" leaf is "*" or equals the name of\
           the YANG module where the requested data node is defined.\
\
        *  Either (1) the rule does not have a "rule-type" defined or\
           (2) the "rule-type" is "data-node" and the "path" matches the\
           requested data node, action node, or notification node.  A\
           path is considered to match if the requested node is the node\
           specified by the path or is a descendant node of the path.\
\
        *  For a "read" access operation, the rule's "access-operations"\
           leaf has the "read" bit set or has the special value "*".\
\
        *  For a "create" access operation, the rule's\
           "access-operations" leaf has the "create" bit set or has the\
           special value "*".\
\
        *  For a "delete" access operation, the rule's\
           "access-operations" leaf has the "delete" bit set or has the\
           special value "*".\

\
\
        *  For an "update" access operation, the rule's\

        operation, "denied" means that the requested data is not\
        returned in the reply.\

   8.   At this point, no matching rule was found in any rule-list\
        entry.\
\
   9.   For a "read" access operation, if the requested data node is\
        defined in a YANG module advertised in the server capabilities\
        and the data definition statement contains a\
        "nacm:default-deny-all" statement, then the requested data node\
        and all its descendants are not included in the reply.\
\
   10.  For a "write" access operation, if the requested data node is\
        defined in a YANG module advertised in the server capabilities\
        and the data definition statement contains a\
        "nacm:default-deny-write" or a "nacm:default-deny-all"\
        statement, then the access request is denied for the data node\
        and all its descendants.\
\
   11.  For a "read" access operation, if the "read-default" leaf is set\
        to "permit", then include the requested data node in the reply;\
        otherwise, do not include the requested data node or any of its\
        descendants in the reply.\
\
   12.  For a "write" access operation, if the "write-default" leaf is\
        set to "permit", then permit the data node access request;\

3.4.6.  Outgoing <notification> Authorization\
\
   Configuration of access control rules specifically for descendant\
   nodes of the notification event type are outside the scope of this\
   document.  If the user is authorized to receive the notification\
   event type, then it is also authorized to receive any data it\
   contains.\

   If the notification is specified within a data subtree, as specified\
   in [RFC7950], then read access to the notification is required.\
   Processing continues as described in Section 3.4.5.\

\
   The generation of a notification for a specific subscription\
   [RFC5277] is authorized by following these steps:\
\
   1.   If the "enable-nacm" leaf is set to "false", then the\
        notification is permitted.\
\
   2.   If the session is identified as a recovery session, then the\
        notification is permitted.\
\
   3.   If the notification is the NETCONF <replayComplete> or\
        <notificationComplete> event type [RFC5277], then the\
        notification is permitted.\
\
   4.   Check all the "group" entries to see if any of them contain a\
        "user-name" entry that equals the username for the session\
        making the request.  If the "enable-external-groups" leaf is\
        "true", add to these groups the set of groups provided by the\
        transport layer.\
\
   5.   If no groups are found, continue with step 10.\
\
   6.   Process all rule-list entries, in the order they appear in the\
        configuration.  If a rule-list's "group" leaf-list does not\
        match any of the user's groups, proceed to the next rule-list\
        entry.\
\
   7.   For each rule-list entry found, process all rules, in order,\
        until a rule that matches the requested access operation is\
        found.  A rule matches if all of the following criteria are met:\
\
        *  The rule's "module-name" leaf is "*" or equals the name of\
           the YANG module where the notification is defined.\
\
        *  Either (1) the rule does not have a "rule-type" defined or\
           (2) the "rule-type" is "notification" and the\
           "notification-name" is "*" or equals the name of the\
           notification.\
\
        *  The rule's "access-operations" leaf has the "read" bit set or\
           has the special value "*".\
\
   8.   If a matching rule is found, then the "action" leaf is checked.\
        If it is equal to "permit", then permit the notification;\
        otherwise, drop the notification for the associated\
        subscription.\
\
   9.   Otherwise, no matching rule was found in any rule-list entry.\

   10.  If the requested notification is defined in a YANG module\

5.  Security Considerations\
\
   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data\
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such\
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer\
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure\
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer\
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS\
   [RFC5246].\
\
   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to\
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a\
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol\
   operations and content.\
\
   There is a risk related to the lack of access control enforcement for\
   the RESTCONF OPTIONS and PATCH methods.  The risk here is that the\
   response to OPTIONS and PATCH may vary based on the presence or\
   absence of a resource corresponding to the URL's path.  If this is\
   the case, then it can be used to trivially probe for the presence or\
   absence of values within a tree.  Therefore, a server MUST NOT vary\

\
\
   its responses based on the existence of the underlying resource,\
   which would indicate the presence or absence of resource instances.\
   In particular, servers should not expose any instance information\
   before ensuring that the client has the necessary access permissions\
   to obtain that information.  In such cases, servers are expected to\
   always return the "access-denied" error response.\
\
   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are\
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the\
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable\
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)\
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative\
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes\
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\
\
   o  /nacm: The entire /nacm subtree is related to security.  Refer to\
      the following sections for more details.\
\
   This section highlights the issues for an administrator to consider\
   when configuring a NETCONF server with the NACM.\
\
5.1.  NACM Configuration and Monitoring Considerations\
\
   Configuration of the access control system is highly sensitive to\
   system security.  A server may choose not to allow any user\
   configuration to some portions of it, such as the global security\
   level or the groups that allowed access to system resources.\
\
   By default, NACM enforcement is enabled.  By default, "read" access\
   to all datastore contents is enabled (unless "nacm:default-deny-all"\
   is specified for the data definition), and "exec" access is enabled\
   for safe protocol operations.  An administrator needs to ensure that\
   the NACM is enabled and also decide if the default access parameters\
   are set appropriately.  Make sure that the following data nodes are\
   properly configured:\
\
   o  /nacm/enable-nacm (default "true")\
\
   o  /nacm/read-default (default "permit")\
\
   o  /nacm/write-default (default "deny")\
\
   o  /nacm/exec-default (default "permit")\
\
   An administrator needs to restrict write access to all configurable\
   objects within this data model.\
\
\
\
\

RFC 8341                          NACM                        March 2018\
\
\
   If write access is allowed for configuration of access control rules,\
   then care needs to be taken not to disrupt the access control\
   enforcement.  For example, if the NACM access control rules are\
   edited directly within the running configuration datastore (i.e.,\
   :writable-running capability is supported and used), then care needs\
   to be taken not to allow unintended access while the edits are being\
   done.\
\
   An administrator needs to make sure that the translation from a\
   transport- or implementation-dependent user identity to a NACM\
   username is unique and correct.  This requirement is specified in\
   detail in Section 2.2 of [RFC6241].\
\
   An administrator needs to be aware that the YANG data structures\
   representing access control rules (/nacm/rule-list and\
   /nacm/rule-list/rule) are ordered by the client.  The server will\
   evaluate the access control rules according to their relative\
   conceptual order within the running configuration datastore.\
\
   Note that the /nacm/groups data structure contains the administrative\
   group names used by the server.  These group names may be configured\
   locally and/or provided through an external protocol, such as RADIUS\
   [RFC2865] [RFC5607].\
\
   An administrator needs to be aware of the security properties of any\
   external protocol used by the transport layer to determine group\
   names.  For example, if this protocol does not protect against\
   man-in-the-middle attacks, an attacker might be able to inject group\
   names that are configured in the NACM so that a user gets more\
   permissions than it should.  In such cases, the administrator may\
   wish to disable the usage of such group names by setting\
   /nacm/enable-external-groups to "false".\
\
   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered\
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus\
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or\
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data\
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\
\
   o  /nacm/enable-nacm\
\
   o  /nacm/read-default\
\
   o  /nacm/write-default\
\
   o  /nacm/exec-default\
\
   o  /nacm/enable-external-groups\
\

\
\
   o  /nacm/groups\
\
   o  /nacm/rule-list\
\
   An administrator needs to restrict read access to the above-listed\
   objects within this data model, as they reveal access control\
   configuration that could be considered sensitive.\
\
5.2.  General Configuration Issues\
\
   There is a risk that invocation of non-standard protocol operations\
   will have undocumented side effects.  An administrator needs to\
   construct access control rules such that the configuration datastore\
   is protected from such side effects.\
\
   It is possible for a session with some write access (e.g., allowed to\
   invoke <edit-config>), but without any access to a particular\
   datastore subtree containing sensitive data, to determine the\
   presence or non-presence of that data.  This can be done by\
   repeatedly issuing some sort of edit request (create, update, or\
   delete) and possibly receiving "access-denied" errors in response.\
   These "fishing" attacks can identify the presence or non-presence of\
   specific sensitive data even without the "error-path" field being\
   present within the <rpc-error> response.\
\
   It may be possible for the set of NETCONF capabilities on the server\
   to change over time.  If so, then there is a risk that new protocol\
   operations, notifications, and/or datastore content have been added\
   to the device.  An administrator needs to be sure that the access\
   control rules are correct for the new content in this case.\
   Mechanisms to detect NETCONF capability changes on a specific device\
   are outside the scope of this document.\
\
   It is possible that the data model definition itself (e.g., a YANG\
   when-stmt) will help an unauthorized session determine the presence\
   or even value of sensitive data nodes by examining the presence and\
   values of different data nodes.\
\
   It is possible that the data model definition itself (e.g., a YANG\
   when-stmt or choice-stmt) will allow a session to implicitly create\
   or delete nodes that the session does not have write access to as an\
   implicit side effect from the processing of an allowed <edit-config>\
   operation.\

RFC 8341                          NACM                        March 2018\
\
\
   There is a risk that non-standard protocol operations, or even the\
   standard <get> protocol operation, may return data that "aliases" or\
   "copies" sensitive data from a different data object.  There may\
   simply be multiple data model definitions that expose or even\
   configure the same underlying system instrumentation.\
\
   A data model may contain external keys (e.g., YANG leafref), which\
   expose values from a different data structure.  An administrator\
   needs to be aware of sensitive data models that contain leafref\
   nodes.  This entails finding all the leafref objects that "point" at\
   the sensitive data (i.e., "path-stmt" values) that implicitly or\
   explicitly includes the sensitive data node.\
\
   It is beyond the scope of this document to define access control\
   enforcement procedures for underlying device instrumentation that may\
   exist to support the NETCONF server operation.  An administrator can\
   identify each protocol operation that the server provides and decide\
   if it needs any access control applied to it.\
\
   This document incorporates the optional use of a recovery session\
   mechanism, which can be used to bypass access control enforcement in\
   emergencies such as NACM configuration errors that disable all access\
   to the server.  The configuration and identification of such a\
   recovery session mechanism are implementation specific and are\
   outside the scope of this document.  An administrator needs to be\
   aware of any recovery session mechanisms available on the device and\
   make sure that they are used appropriately.\
\
   It is possible for a session to disrupt configuration management,\
   even without any write access to the configuration, by locking the\
   datastore.  This may be done to ensure that all or part of the\
   configuration remains stable while it is being retrieved, or it may\
   be done as a "denial-of-service" attack.  There is no way for the\
   server to know the difference.  An administrator may wish to restrict\
   "exec" access to the following protocol operations:\
\
   o  <lock>\
\
   o  <unlock>\
\
   o  <partial-lock>\
\
   o  <partial-unlock>\
\

\
\
5.3.  Data Model Design Considerations\
\
   Designers need to clearly identify any sensitive data, notifications,\
   or protocol operations defined within a YANG module.  For such\
   definitions, a "nacm:default-deny-write" or "nacm:default-deny-all"\
   statement ought to be present, in addition to a clear description of\
   the security risks.\
\
   Protocol operations need to be properly documented by the data model\
   designer so that it is clear to administrators what data nodes (if\
   any) are affected by the protocol operation and what information (if\
   any) is returned in the <rpc-reply> message.\
\
   Data models ought to be designed so that different access levels for\
   input parameters to protocol operations are not required.  The use of\
   generic protocol operations should be avoided, and if different\
   access levels are needed, separate protocol operations should be\
   defined instead.\

Appendix A.  Usage Examples\
\
   The following XML [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] snippets are provided as\
   examples only, to demonstrate how the NACM can be configured to\
   perform some access control tasks.\
\
A.1.  <groups> Example\
\
   There needs to be at least one <group> entry in order for any of the\
   access control rules to be useful.\
\
   The following XML shows arbitrary groups and is not intended to\
   represent any particular use case.\
\
   <nacm xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-acm">\
     <groups>\
       <group>\
         <name>admin</name>\
         <user-name>admin</user-name>\
         <user-name>andy</user-name>\
       </group>\
\
       <group>\
         <name>limited</name>\
         <user-name>wilma</user-name>\
         <user-name>bam-bam</user-name>\
       </group>\
\
       <group>\
         <name>guest</name>\
         <user-name>guest</user-name>\
         <user-name>guest@example.com</user-name>\
       </group>\
     </groups>\
   </nacm>\
\
   This example shows three groups:\
\
   admin:  The "admin" group contains two users named "admin" and\
      "andy".\
\
   limited:  The "limited" group contains two users named "wilma" and\
      "bam-bam".\
\
   guest:  The "guest" group contains two users named "guest" and\
      "guest@example.com".\

A.2.  Module Rule Example\
\
   Module rules are used to control access to all the content defined in\
   a specific module.  A module rule has the "module-name" leaf set but\

\
   This example shows four module rules:\
\
   deny-ncm:  This rule prevents the "guest" group from reading any\
      monitoring information in the "ietf-netconf-monitoring" YANG\
      module.\
\
   permit-ncm:  This rule allows the "limited" group to read the\
      "ietf-netconf-monitoring" YANG module.\
\
   permit-exec:  This rule allows the "limited" group to invoke any\
      protocol operation supported by the server.\
\
   permit-all:  This rule allows the "admin" group complete access to\
      all content in the server.  No subsequent rule will match for the\
      "admin" group because of this module rule.\

\
   deny-nacm:  This rule denies the "guest" group any access to the\
      /nacm subtree.\
\
   permit-acme-config:  This rule gives the "limited" group read-write\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This document specifies extensions to the IETF TRILL (Transparent\
   Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7177]\
   [RFC7780] to support multi-topology routing for both unicast and\
   multi-destination traffic based on IS-IS (Intermediate System to\
   Intermediate System) [IS-IS] multi-topology [RFC5120].\
   Implementation and use of multi-topology are optional, and use\
   requires configuration.  It is anticipated that not all TRILL\
   campuses will need or use multi-topology.\

RFC 8377                  TRILL: Multi-Topology                July 2018\
\
\
   Multi-topology creates different topologies or subsets from a single\
   physical TRILL campus topology.  This is different from Data Labels\
   (VLANs and Fine-Grained Labels (FGLs) [RFC7172]).  Data Labels\
   specify communities of end stations and can be viewed as creating\
   virtual topologies of end station connectivity.  However, in a single\
   topology TRILL campus, TRILL Data packets can use any part of the\
   physical topology of TRILL switches and links between TRILL switches,\
   regardless of the Data Label of that packet's payload.  In a multi-\
   topology TRILL campus, TRILL data packets in a topology are\
   restricted to the TRILL switches and links that are in their\
   topology, regardless of the Data Label of their payload.\
\
   The essence of multi-topology behavior is that a multi-topology\
   router classifies packets as to the topology within which they should\
   be routed and uses logically different routing tables for different\
   topologies.  If routers in the network do not agree on the topology\
   classification of packets or links, persistent routing loops can\
   occur.  It is the responsibility of the network manager to\
   consistently configure multi-topology to avoid such routing loops.\
\
   The multi-topology TRILL extensions can be used for a wide variety of\
   purposes, such as maintaining separate routing domains for isolated\
   multicast or IPv6 islands, routing a class of traffic so that it\
   avoids certain TRILL switches that lack some characteristic needed by\
   that traffic, or making a class of traffic avoid certain links due to\
   security, reliability, or other concerns.\
\
   It is possible for a particular topology to not be fully connected,\
   either intentionally or due to node or link failures or incorrect\
   configuration.  This results in two or more islands of that topology\
   that cannot communicate.  In such a case, end stations connected in\
   that topology to different islands will be unable to communicate with\
   each other.\
\
   Multi-topology TRILL supports regions of topology-ignorant TRILL\
   switches as part of a multi-topology campus; however, such regions\
   can only ingress to, egress from, or transit TRILL Data packets in\
   the special base topology zero.\

RFC 8377                  TRILL: Multi-Topology                July 2018\
\
\
1.1.  Terminology\
\
   The terminology and abbreviations of [RFC6325] are used in this\
   document.  Some of these are paraphrased below for convenience.  Some\
   additional terms are also listed.\
\
      campus: The name for a TRILL network, like "bridged LAN" is a name\
         for a bridged network.  It does not have any academic\
         implication.\
\
      DRB: Designated RBridge [RFC7177].\
\
      FGL: Fine-Grained Labeling or Fine-Grained Labeled or Fine-Grained\
         Label [RFC7172].  By implication, an "FGL TRILL switch" does\
         not support Multi-Topology (MT).\
\
      IS: Intermediate System [IS-IS].\
\
      LSP: Link State PDU (Protocol Data Unit) [IS-IS].  For TRILL, this\
         includes Level 1 LSPs and Extended Level 1 Flooding Scope LSPs\
         [RFC7780].\
\
      MT: Multi-Topology [RFC5120].\
\
      MT TRILL Switch: A TRILL switch supporting the multi-topology\
         feature specified in this document.  An MT TRILL switch MUST\
         support FGL in the sense that it MUST be FGL safe [RFC7172].\
\
      RBridge: Routing Bridge; an alternative name for a TRILL switch.\
\
      TRILL: Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links or Tunneled\
         Routing in the Link Layer [RFC6325].\
\
      TRILL Switch: A device implementing the TRILL protocol.  TRILL\
         switches are Intermediate Systems (routers) [IS-IS].\
\
      VL: VLAN Labeling or VLAN Labeled or VLAN Label [RFC7172].  By\
         implication, a "VL RBridge" or "VL TRILL switch" does not\
         support FGL or MT.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\

RFC 8377                  TRILL: Multi-Topology                July 2018\
\
\
2.  Topologies\
\
   In TRILL multi-topology, a topology is a subset of the TRILL switches\
   and of the links between TRILL switches in the TRILL campus.  TRILL\
   Data packets are constrained to the subset of switches and links\
   corresponding to the packet's topology.  TRILL multi-topology is\
   based on IS-IS multi-topology [RFC5120].  See Appendix A for\
   differences between TRILL multi-topology and [RFC5120].\
\
   The zero topology is special, as described in Section 2.1.  Sections\
   2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 discuss the topology of links, TRILL switches, and\
   TRILL Data packets, respectively.\
\
2.1.  Special Topology Zero\
\
   The zero topology is special as the default base topology.  All TRILL\
   switches and links are considered to be in, and MUST support,\
   topology zero.  Thus, for example, topology zero can be used for\
   general TRILL switch access within a campus for management messages,\
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) messages [RFC7175], RBridge\
   Channel messages [RFC7178], and the like.\
\
2.2.  Links and Multi-Topology\
\
   Multi-topology TRILL switches advertise the topologies for which they\
   are willing to send and receive TRILL Data packets on a port by\
   listing those topologies in one or more MT TLVs [RFC5120] appearing\
   in every TRILL Hello [RFC7177] they send out that port, except that\
   they MUST handle topology zero, which it is optional to list.\
\
   A link is usable for TRILL Data packets in non-zero topology T only\
   if:\
\
   (1) all TRILL switch ports on the link advertise topology T support\
       in their Hellos, and\
\
   (2) if any TRILL switch port on the link requires explicit TRILL Data\
       packet topology labeling (see Section 2.4) every other TRILL\
       switch port on the link is capable of generating explicit packet\
       topology labeling.\

\
\
2.3.  TRILL Switches and Multi-Topology\
\
   A TRILL switch advertises the topologies that it supports by listing\
   them in one or more MT TLVs [RFC5120] in its LSP, except that it MUST\
   support topology zero, which is optional to list.  For robust and\
   rapid flooding, MT TLV(s) SHOULD be advertised in core LSP fragment\
   zero.\
\
   There is no "MT capability bit".  A TRILL switch advertises that it\
   is MT capable by advertising in its LSP support for any topology or\
   topologies with the MT TLV, even if it just explicitly advertises\
   support for topology zero.\
\
2.4.  TRILL Data Packets and Multi-Topology\
\
   The topology of a TRILL Data packet is commonly determined from\
   either (1) some field or fields present in the packet itself or (2)\
   the port on which the packet was received; however, optional explicit\
   topology labeling of TRILL Data packets is also proved.  This can be\
   included in the data labeling area of TRILL Data packets as specified\
   below.\
\
   Examples of fields that might be used to determine topology are\
   values or ranges of values of the payload VLAN or FGL [RFC7172],\
   packet priority, IP version (IPv6 versus IPv4) or IP protocol,\
   Ethertype, unicast versus multi-destination payload, IP\
   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) bits, or the like.\
\
   Multi-topology does not apply to TRILL IS-IS packets or to link level\
   control frames.  Those messages are link local and can be thought of\
   as being above all topologies.  Multi-topology only applies to TRILL\
   Data packets.\

\
\
2.4.1.  Explicit Topology Labeling Support\
\
   Support of the topology label is optional.  Support could depend on\
   port hardware and is indicated by a 2-bit capability field in the\
   Port TRILL Version sub-TLV [RFC7176] appearing in the Port\
   Capabilities TLV in Hellos.  If there is no Port TRILL Capabilities\
   sub-TLV in a Hello, then it is assumed that explicit topology\
   labeling is not supported on that port.  See the table below for the\
   meaning of values of the Explicit Topology capability field:\
\
      Value   Meaning\
      -----   -------\
       0       No support.  Cannot send TRILL Data packets with an\
               explicit topology label and will likely treat as\
               erroneous and discard any TRILL Data packet received with\
               a topology label.  Such a port is assumed to have the\
               ability and configuration to correctly classify TRILL\
               Data packets into all topologies for which it is\
               advertising support in its Hellos, either by examining\
               those packets or because they are arriving at that port.\
\
       1       Capable of inserting an explicit topology label in TRILL\
               Data packets sent and tolerant of such labels in received\
               TRILL Data packets.  Such a port is capable, for all of\
               the topologies it supports, of determining TRILL Data\
               packet topology without an explicit label.  Thus, it does\
               not require such a label in received TRILL Data packets.\
               On receiving a packet whose explicit topology label\
               differs from the port's topology determination for that\
               packet, the TRILL switch MUST discard the packet.\
\
    2 & 3      Require an explicit topology label in received TRILL Data\
               packets except for topology zero.  Any TRILL Data packets\
               received without such a label are classified as being in\
               topology zero.   Also capable of inserting an explicit\
               topology label in TRILL Data packets sent.  (Values 2 and\
               3 are treated the same, which is the same as saying that\
               if the 2 bit is on, the 1 bit is ignored.)\
\
   In a Hello on Port P, a TRILL switch advertising support for topology\
   T but not advertising that it requires explicit topology labeling is\
   assumed to have the ability and configuration to correctly classify\
   TRILL Data packets into topology T by examination of those TRILL Data\
   packets and/or by using the fact that they are arriving at port P.\
\
   When a TRILL switch transmits a TRILL Data packet onto a link, if any\
   other TRILL switch on that link requires explicit topology labeling,\
   an explicit topology label MUST be included unless the TRILL Data\

\
   packet is in topology zero, in which case, an explicit topology label\
   MAY be included.  If a topology label is not so required, but all\
   other TRILL switches on that link support explicit topology labeling,\
   then such a label MAY be included.\
\
2.4.2.  The Explicit Topology Label\
\
   This section specifies the explicit topology label.  Its use by TRILL\
   is specified in Section 2.4.3.  This label may be used by other\
   technologies besides TRILL.  The MT Label is structured as follows:\
\
    0                   1                   2                   3\
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\
\
                            Figure 1: MT Label\
\
   Where the fields are as follows:\
\
   MT Ethertype: The MT Label Ethertype (see Section 6.1).\
\
   V: The version number of the MT Label.  This document specifies\
      version zero.\
\
   R: A 2-bit reserved field that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on\
      receipt.\
\
   MT-ID: The 12-bit topology using the topology number space of the MT\
      TLV [RFC5120].\
\
2.4.3.  TRILL Use of the MT Label\
\
   With the addition of the version zero MT Label, the four standardized\
   content varieties for the TRILL Data packet data labeling area (the\
   area after the Inner.MacSA -- or Flag Word if the Flag Word is\
   present [RFC7780] -- and before the payload) are as show below.\
   TRILL Data packets received with any other data labeling are\
   discarded.  {PRI, D} is a 3-bit priority and a drop eligibility\
   indicator bit [RFC7780].\
\
   All MT TRILL switches MUST support FGL, in the sense of being FGL\
   safe [RFC7172]; thus, they MUST support all four data labeling area\
   contents shown below.  (This requirement is imposed, rather than\
   having FGL support and MT support be independent, to reduce the\
   number of variations in RBridges and simplify testing.)\

\
\
3.  TRILL Multi-Topology Adjacency and Routing\
\
   Routing calculations in IS-IS are based on adjacency.  Section 3.1\
   specifies multi-topology TRILL adjacency.  Section 3.2 describes the\
   handling of nicknames.  Sections 3.3 and 3.4 specify how unicast and\
   multi-destination TRILL multi-topology routing differ from the TRILL\
   base protocol routing.\
\
3.1.  Adjacency\
\
   There is no change in the determination or announcement of adjacency\
   for topology zero, which is as specified in [RFC7177].  When a\
   topology zero adjacency reaches the Report state, as specified in\
   [RFC7177], the adjacency is announced in core LSPs using the Extended\
   Intermediate System Reachability TLV (#22).  This will be compatible\
   with any legacy topology-ignorant RBridges that might not support E-\
   L1FS FS-LSPs [RFC7780].\
\
   Adjacency is announced for non-zero topologies in LSPs using the MT\
   Reachable Intermediate Systems TLV (#222) as specified in [RFC5120].\
   A TRILL switch reports adjacency for non-zero topology T if and only\
   if that adjacency is in the Report state [RFC7177] and the two\
   conditions listed in Section 2.2 are true, namely:\
\
   1. All the ports on the link are announcing support of topology T.\
\
   2. If any port announces that it requires explicit topology labeling\
      (Explicit Topology capability field value 2 or 3), all other ports\
      advertise that they are capable of producing such labeling\
      (Explicit Topology capability field value of 1, 2, or 3).\
\
3.2.  TRILL Switch Nicknames\
\
   TRILL switches are usually identified within the TRILL protocol (for\
   example, in the TRILL Header) by nicknames [RFC6325] [RFC7780].  Such\
   nicknames can be viewed as simply 16-bit abbreviation for a TRILL\
   switch's (or pseudo-node's) 7-byte IS-IS System ID.  A TRILL switch\
   or pseudo-node can have more than one nickname, each of which\
   identifies it.\
\
   Nicknames are common across all topologies, just as IS-IS System IDs\
   are.  Nicknames are determined as specified in [RFC6325] and\
   [RFC7780] using only the Nickname sub-TLVs appearing in Router\
   Capabilities TLVs (#242) advertised by TRILL switches.  In\
   particular, the nickname allocation algorithm ignores Nickname sub-\
   TLVs that appear in MT Router Capability TLVs (#144).  (However,\
\
\
\
\
\
Eastlake, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 10]\
\
RFC 8377                  TRILL: Multi-Topology                July 2018\
\
\
   Nickname sub-TLVs that appear in MT Router Capability TLVs with a\
   non-zero topology do affect the choice of distribution tree roots as\
   described in Section 3.4.1.)\
\
   To minimize transient inconsistencies, all Nickname sub-TLVs\
   advertised by a TRILL switch for a particular nickname, whether in\
   Router Capability or MT Router Capability TLVs, SHOULD appear in the\
   same LSP PDU.  If that is not the case, then all LSP PDUs in which\
   they do occur SHOULD be flooded as an atomic action.\
\
3.3.  TRILL Unicast Routing\
\
   TRILL Data packets being TRILL unicast (those with TRILL Header M bit\
   = 0) are routed based on the egress nickname using logically separate\
   forwarding tables per topology T, where each such table has been\
   calculated based on least cost routing within T: that is, only using\
   links and nodes that support T.  Thus, the next hop when forwarding\
   TRILL Data packets is determined by a lookup logically based on\
   {topology, egress nickname}.\
\
3.4.  TRILL Multi-Destination Routing\
\
   TRILL sends multi-destination data packets (those packets with TRILL\
   Header M bit = 1) over a distribution tree.  Trees are designated by\
   nicknames that appear in the "egress nickname" field of multi-\
   destination TRILL Data packet TRILL Headers.  To constrain multi-\
   destination packets to a topology T and still distribute them\
   properly requires the use of a distribution tree constrained to T.\
   Handling such TRILL Data packets and distribution trees in TRILL MT\
   is as described in the subsections below.\
\
3.4.1.  Distribution Trees\
\
   General provisions for distribution trees and how those trees are\
   determined are as specified in [RFC6325], [RFC7172], and [RFC7780].\
   The distribution trees for topology zero are determined as specified\
   in those references and are the same as they would be with topology-\
   ignorant TRILL switches.\
\
   The TRILL distribution tree construction and packet handling for some\
   non-zero topology T are determined as specified in [RFC6325],\
   [RFC7172], and [RFC7780] with the following changes:\
\
      o  As specified in [RFC5120], only links usable with topology T\
         TRILL Data packets are considered when building a distribution\
         tree for topology T.  As a result, such trees are automatically\
         limited to and separately span every internally connected\

\
\
         island of topology T.  In other words, if non-zero topology T\
         consists of disjoint islands, each distribution tree\
         construction for topology T is local to one such island.\
\
      o  Only the Nickname sub-TLV, Trees sub-TLV, Tree Identifiers sub-\
         TLV, and Trees Used sub-TLV occurring in an MT Router\
         Capabilities TLV (#144) specifying topology T are used in\
         determining the tree root(s), if any, for a connected area of\
         non-zero topology T.\
\
         +  There may be non-zero topologies with no multi-destination\
            traffic or, as described in [RFC5120], even topologies with\
            no traffic at all.  For example, if only known destination\
            unicast IPv6 TRILL Data packets were in topology T and all\
            multi-destination IPv6 TRILL Data packets were in some other\
            topology, there would be no need for a distribution tree for\
            topology T.  For this reason, a Number of Trees to Compute\
            field value of zero in the Trees sub-TLV for the TRILL\
            switch holding the highest priority to be a tree root for a\
            non-zero topology T is honored and causes no distribution\
            trees to be calculated for non-zero topology T.  This is\
            different from the base topology zero where, as specified in\
            [RFC6325], a zero Number of Trees to Compute field value\
            causes one tree to be computed.\
\
      o  Nicknames are allocated as described in Section 3.2.  If a\
         TRILL switch advertising that it provides topology T service\
         holds nickname N, the priority of N to be a tree root is given\
         by the tree root priority field of the Nickname sub-TLV that\
         has N in its nickname field and occurs in a topology T MT\
         Router Capabilities TLV advertised by that TRILL switch.  If no\
         such Nickname sub-TLV can be found, the priority of N to be a\
         tree root is the default for an FGL TRILL switch as specified\
         in [RFC7172].\
\
         +  There could be multiple topology T Nickname sub-TLVs for N\
            being advertised for a particular RBridge or pseudo-node,\
            due to transient conditions or errors.  In that case, any\
            advertised in a core LSP PDU are preferred to those\
            advertised in an E-L1FS FS-LSP PDU.  Within those\
            categories, the one in the lowest numbered fragment is used\
            and if there are multiple in that fragment, the one with the\
            smallest offset from the beginning of the PDU is used.\
\
      o  Tree pruning for topology T uses only the Interested VLANs sub-\
         TLVs and Interested Labels sub-TLVs [RFC7176] advertised in MT\
         Router Capabilities TLVs for topology T.\

\
\
   An MT TRILL switch MUST have logically separate routing tables per\
   topology for the forwarding of multi-destination traffic.\
\
3.4.2.  Multi-Access Links\
\
   Multi-destination TRILL Data packets are forwarded on broadcast\
   (multi-access) links in such a way as to be received by all other\
   TRILL switch ports on the link.  For example, on Ethernet links they\
   are sent with a multicast Outer.MacDA [RFC6325].  Care must be taken\
   that a TRILL Data packet in a non-zero topology is only forwarded by\
   an MT TRILL switch.\
\
   For this reason, a non-zero topology TRILL Data packet MUST NOT be\
   forwarded onto a link unless the link meets the requirements\
   specified in Section 2.2 for use in that topology even if there are\
   one or more MT TRILL switch ports on the link.\
\
4.  Mixed Links\
\
   There might be any combination of MT, FGL, or even VL TRILL switches\
   [RFC7172] on a link.  DRB (Designated RBridge) election and Forwarder\
   appointment on the link work as previously specified in [RFC8139] and\
   [RFC7177].  It is up to the network manager to configure and manage\
   the TRILL switches on a link so that the desired switch is DRB and\
   the desired switch is the Appointed Forwarder for the appropriate\
   VLANs.\
\
   Frames ingressed by MT TRILL switches can potentially be in any\
   topology recognized by the switch and permitted on the ingress port.\
   Frames ingressed by VL or FGL TRILL switches can only be in the base\
   zero topology.  Because FGL and VL TRILL switches do not understand\
   topologies, all occurrences of the following sub-TLVs MUST occur only\
   in MT Port Capability TLVs with a zero MT-ID.  Any occurrence of\
   these sub-TLVs in an MT Port Capability TLV with a nonzero MT-ID is\
   ignored.\
\
      Special VLANs and Flags Sub-TLV\
      Enabled-VLANs Sub-TLV\
      Appointed Forwarders Sub-TLV\
      VLANs Appointed Sub-TLV\
\
   Native frames cannot be explicitly labeled (see Section 2.4) as to\
   their topology.\

\
\
5.  Other Multi-Topology Considerations\
\
5.1.  Address Learning\
\
   The learning of end station Media Access Control (MAC) addresses is\
   per topology as well as per label (VLAN or FGL).  The same MAC\
   address can occur within a TRILL campus for different end stations\
   that differ only in topology without confusion.\
\
5.1.1.  Data Plane Learning\
\
   End station MAC addresses learned from ingressing native frames or\
   egressing TRILL Data packets are, for MT TRILL switches, qualified by\
   topology.  That is, either the topology into which that TRILL switch\
   classified the ingressed native frame or the topology that the\
   egressed TRILL Data frame was in.\
\
5.1.2.  Multi-Topology ESADI\
\
   In an MT TRILL switch, End Station Address Distribution Information\
   (ESADI) [RFC7357] operates per label (VLAN or FGL) per topology.\
   Since ESADI messages appear, to transit TRILL switches, like normal\
   multi-destination TRILL Data packets, ESADI link state databases and\
   ESADI protocol operation are per topology as well as per label and\
   local to each area of multi-destination TRILL data connectivity for\
   that topology.\
\
5.2.  Legacy Stubs\
\
   Areas of topology-ignorant TRILL switches can be connected to and\
   become part of an MT TRILL campus but will only be able to ingress\
   to, transit, or egress from topology zero TRILL Data packets.\
\
5.3.  RBridge Channel Messages\
\
   RBridge Channel messages [RFC7178], such as BFD over TRILL [RFC7175]\
   appear, to transit TRILL switches, like normal multi-destination\
   TRILL Data packets.  Thus, they have a topology and, if that topology\
   is non-zero, are constrained by topology like other TRILL Data\
   packets.  Generally, when sent for network management purposes, they\
   are sent in topology zero to avoid such constraint.\

\
\
5.4.  Implementations Considerations\
\
   MT is an optional TRILL switch capability.\
\
   Experience with the actual deployment of Layer 3 IS-IS MT [RFC5120]\
   indicates that a single router handling more than eight topologies is\
   rare.  There may be many more than eight distinct topologies in a\
   routed area, such as a TRILL campus; in that case, many of these\
   topologies will be handled by disjoint sets of routers and/or links.\
\
   Based on this deployment experience, a TRILL switch capable of\
   handling eight or more topologies can be considered a full\
   implementation while a TRILL switch capable of handling four\
   topologies can be considered a minimal implementation but still\
   useful under some circumstances.\
\
6.  Allocation Considerations\
\
   IEEE Registration Authority and IANA considerations are given below.\
\
6.1.  IEEE Registration Authority Considerations\
\
   The IEEE Registration Authority has allocated Ethertype 0x9A22 for\
   the MT Label (see Section 2.4).\
\
6.2.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has assigned a field of two adjacent bits (14-15) of the\
   Capabilities bits of the Port TRILL Version Sub-TLV for the Explicit\
   Topology capability field and updated the "PORT-TRILL-VER Sub-TLV\
   Capability Flags" registry as follows.\

RFC 8377                  TRILL: Multi-Topology                July 2018\
\
\
   IANA has created the informational "TRILL Ethertypes" subregistry in\
   the "Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Parameters"\
   registry.\
\
   Name: TRILL Ethertypes\
   Registration Procedure(s): Ethertypes are assigned by the IEEE\
      Registration Authority.  Updates to this registry are coordinated\
      with the designated expert.\
   Reference: [RFC8377]\
\
   Note: This registry provides centralized documentation of\
      Ethertypes that were assigned by the IEEE for initial use\
      with TRILL.  In some cases, particularly L2-IS-IS and MT,\
      they may be used with other protocols.\

\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   Multiple topologies are sometimes used for the isolation or security\
   of traffic.  For example, if some links were more likely than others\
   to be subject to adversarial observation, it might be desirable to\
   classify certain sensitive traffic in a topology that excluded those\
   links.\
\
   Delivery of data originating in one topology outside of that topology\
   is generally a security policy violation to be avoided at all\
   reasonable costs.  Using IS-IS security [RFC5310] on all IS-IS PDUs\
   and link security appropriate to the link technology on all links\
   involved, particularly those between RBridges, supports the avoidance\
   of such violations.\
\
   For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].\

\
\
Appendix A.  Differences from RFC 5120\
\
   TRILL multi-topology, as specified in this document, differs from RFC\
   5120 as follows:\
\
   1. [RFC5120] provides for unicast multi-topology.  This document\
      extends that to cover multi-destination TRILL data distribution\
      (see Section 3.4).\
\
   2. [RFC5120] assumes the topology of data packets is always\
      determined implicitly, that is, based on the port over which the\
      packets are received and/or preexisting fields within the packet.\
      This document supports such implicit determination, but it extends\
      this by providing for optional explicit topology labeling of data\
      packets (see Section 2.4).\
\
   3. [RFC5120] makes support of the default topology zero optional for\
      MT routers and links.  For simplicity and ease in network\
      management, this document requires all TRILL switches and links\
      between TRILL switches to support topology zero (see Section 2.1).\

RFC 8371              MN Identifier Types for MIPv6            July 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The "Mobile Node Identifier Option for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)" [RFC4283]\
   has proved to be a popular design tool for providing identifiers for\
   mobile nodes during authentication procedures with Authentication,\
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols such as Diameter\
   [RFC6733].  To date, only a single type of identifier has been\
   specified, namely the Mobile Node (MN) NAI.  Other types of\
   identifiers are in common use and are even referenced in RFC 4283.\
   In this document, we propose adding some basic identifier types that\
   are defined in various telecommunications standards, including types\
   for International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [ThreeGPP-IDS],\
   Packet - Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (P-TMSI)\
   [ThreeGPP-IDS], International Mobile station Equipment Identities\
   (IMEI) [ThreeGPP-IDS], and Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity\
   (GUTI) [ThreeGPP-IDS].  In addition, we specify the IPv6 address\
   itself and IEEE MAC-layer addresses as Mobile Node identifiers.\
   Defining identifiers that are tied to the physical elements of the\
   device (e.g., the MAC address) help in deployment of Mobile IP\
   because, in many cases, such identifiers are the most natural means\
   for uniquely identifying the device and will avoid additional lookup\
   steps that might be needed if other identifiers were used.\
\
2.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\

   The following types of identifiers are commonly used to identify\
   mobile nodes.  For each type, references are provided with full\
   details on the format of the type of identifier.\

\
4.  Descriptions of MN Identifier Types\
\
   This section provides descriptions for the various MN identifier\
   types.\
\
4.1.  Description of the IPv6 Address Type\
\
   The IPv6 address [RFC4291] is encoded as a 16-octet string containing\
   a full IPv6 address that has been assigned to the mobile node.  The\
   IPv6 address MUST be a unicast routable IPv6 address.  Multicast\
   addresses, link-local addresses, and the unspecified IPv6 address\
   MUST NOT be used.  IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) MAY be used as\
   long as any security operations making use of the ULA also take into\
   account the domain in which the ULA is guaranteed to be unique.\

RFC 8371              MN Identifier Types for MIPv6            July 2018\
\
\
4.2.  Description of the IMSI MN Identifier Type\
\
   The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [ThreeGPP-IDS] is\
   at most 15 decimal digits (i.e., digits from 0 through 9).  The IMSI\
   MUST be encoded as a string of octets in network order (i.e., high to\
   low for all digits), where each digit occupies 4 bits.  If needed for\
   full octet size, the last digit MUST be padded with 0xf.  For\
   instance, an example IMSI 123456123456789 would be encoded as\
   follows:\
\
      0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9f\
\
4.3.  Description of the EUI-48 Address Type\
\
   The IEEE EUI-48 address [IEEE802-GUIDELINES] is encoded as 6 octets\
   containing the IEEE EUI-48 address.\
\
4.4.  Description of the EUI-64 Address Type\
\
   The IEEE EUI-64 address [IEEE802-GUIDELINES] is encoded as 8 octets\
   containing the full IEEE EUI-64 address.\
\
4.5.  Description of the DUID Type\
\
   The DUID is the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier [RFC3315].  There are\
   various types of DUIDs, which are distinguished by an initial two-\
   octet type field.  Clients and servers MUST treat DUIDs as opaque\
   values and MUST only compare DUIDs for equality.\
\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms and does not\
   have any impact on existing security mechanisms.\
\
   Mobile node identifiers such as those described in this document are\
   considered to be private information.  If used in the MN identifier\
   extension as defined in [RFC4283], the packet including the MN\
   identifier extension MUST be encrypted so that no personal\
   information or trackable identifiers are inadvertently disclosed to\
   passive observers.  Operators can potentially apply IPsec\
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] in transport mode with\
   confidentiality and integrity protection for protecting the identity\
   and location information in MIPv6 signaling messages.\
\
   Some MN identifiers contain sensitive identifiers that, as used in\
   protocols specified by other Standards Development Organizations\
   (SDOs), are only used for signaling during initial network entry.  In\
   such protocols, subsequent exchanges then rely on a temporary\

\
\
   identifier allocated during the initial network entry.  Managing the\
   association between long-lived and temporary identifiers is outside\
   the scope of this document.\
\
6.  IANA Considerations\
\
   The new mobile node identifier types defined in this document have\
   been assigned values from the "Mobile Node Identifier Option\
   Subtypes" registry.  The following values have been registered.\
\
               +-----------------+------------------------+\
               | Identifier Type | Identifier Type Number |\
               +-----------------+------------------------+\
               | IPv6 Address    | 2                      |\
               | IMSI            | 3                      |\
               | P-TMSI          | 4                      |\
               | EUI-48 address  | 5                      |\
               | EUI-64 address  | 6                      |\
               | GUTI            | 7                      |\
               | DUID            | 8                      |\
               | Reserved        | 9-15                   |\
               | Unassigned      | 16-255                 |\
               +-----------------+------------------------+\
\
                 Table 2: New Mobile Node Identifier Types\
\
   See Section 4 for additional information about the identifier types.\
   The registration procedure is Standards Action [RFC8126].  The expert\
   must ascertain that the identifier type allows unique identification\
   of the mobile device; since all MN identifiers require encryption,\
   there is no additional privacy exposure attendant to the use of new\
   types.\

Appendix A.  RFID Types\
\
   The material in this non-normative appendix was originally composed\
   for inclusion in the main body of the specification but was moved\
   into an appendix because there was insufficient support for\
   allocating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) types at the time.\
   It was observed that RFID-based mobile devices may create privacy\
   exposures unless confidentiality is assured for signaling.  A\
   specification for eliminating unauthorized RFID tracking based on\
   Layer 2 addresses would be helpful.\
\
   Much of the following text is due to contributions from Hakima\
   Chaouchi.  For an overview and some initial suggestions about using\
   RFID with IPv6 on mobile devices, see [Using-RFID-IPv6].\
\
   In the context of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, vertical\
   domain, efficient inventory, and tracking items are of major\
   interest, and RFID technology is the identification technology in the\
   hardware design of many such items.\
\
   The "TRACK-IoT" project [TRACK-IoT] [RFID-framework] explored Mobile\
   IPv6 as a mobility management protocol for RFID-based mobile devices.\
\
   1.  Passive RFID tags (that have no processing resources) need to be\
       handled by the gateway (likely also the RFID reader), which is\
       then the endpoint of the mobility protocol.  It is also the point\
       where the Change of Address (CoA) will be created based on some\
       combination such as the RFID tag and the prefix of that gateway.\
       The point here is to offer the possibility to passive RFID items\
       to get an IPv6 address and take advantage of the mobility\
       framework to follow the mobile device (passive tag on the item).\
       One example scenario that has been proposed, which shows the need\
       for mobility management of passive RFID items, would be pieces of\
       art tagged with passive tags that need to be monitored while\
       transported.\
\
   2.  Using active RFID tags (where the processing resource is\
       available on the tag), the endpoint of the mobility protocol can\
       be hosted directly on the RFID active tag, which is also called\
       an identification sensor.  A use case for active RFID tags\
       includes traceability of cold food during mobility (transport).\
       Also, mobility of cars equipped with active RFID tags that we\
       already use for toll payment can be added with mobility\
       management.\
\
   One major effort to connect IETF efforts to EPCglobal (RFID\
   standardization) led to the Object Name Service (ONS), which is the\
   DNS version applied for RFID logical names and page information\

\
   retrieval.  Attempts have been made to connect IPv6 on the address\
   space to RFID identifier format.  Other initiatives started working\
   on gateways to map tag identifiers with IPv6 addresses and build\
   signaling protocols for the application level.  For instance,\
   tracking of mobile items equipped with a tag can be triggered\
   remotely by a remote correspondent node until a visiting area where a\
   mobile item equipped with an RFID tag is located.  An RFID reader\
   will be added with an IPv6-to-RFID tag translation.  One option is to\
   build a home IPv6 address of that tagged item by using the prefix of\
   the home agent combined with the tag RFID identifier of the mobile\
   item; as the tag ID is unique, the home IPv6 address of that item\
   will be also unique.  Then, the visiting RFID reader will compose the\
   IPv6 care of address of the tagged mobile item by combining the\
   prefix of the RFID reader with the tag ID of the item.  MIPv6 can\
   then normally provide the mobility management of that RFID-tagged\
   item.  A different, useful example of tagged items involves items of\
   a factory that can be tracked while they are transported, especially\
   for real-time localization and tracking of precious items transported\
   without GPS.  An automotive car manufacturer can assign IPv6\
   addresses corresponding to RFID-tagged cars or mechanical car parts\
   and build a tracking data set of the mobility not only of the cars,\
   but also of the mechanical pieces.\
\
   The Tag Data Standard promoted by Electronic Product Code (EPC)\
   [EPC-Tag-Data] supports several encoding systems or schemes, which\
   are commonly used in RFID applications, including the following:\
\
   o  RFID-GID (Global Identifier),\
\
   o  RFID-SGTIN (Serialized Global Trade Item Number),\
\
   o  RFID-SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code),\
\
   o  RFID-SGLN (Serialized Global Location Number),\
\

RFC 8371              MN Identifier Types for MIPv6            July 2018\
\
\
   For each RFID scheme except GID, there are three representations:\
\
   o  a 64-bit binary representation (for example, SGLN-64), excluding\
      GID,\
\
   o  a 96-bit binary representation (SGLN-96), and\
\
   o  a representation as a URI.\
\
   The URI representation for the RFID is actually a URN.  The EPC\
   document has the following language:\
\
      All categories of URIs are represented as Uniform Reference Names\
      (URNs) as defined by [RFC2141], where the URN Namespace is epc.\
\
   The following list includes the above RFID types.\

RFC 8371              MN Identifier Types for MIPv6            July 2018\
\
\
A.1.  Description of the RFID Types\
\
   The material in this appendix has been either quoted or loosely\
   adapted from [EPC-Tag-Data].\
\
   The General Identifier (GID) that is used with RFID is composed of\
   three fields: General Manager Number, Object Class, and Serial\
   Number.  The General Manager Number identifies an organizational\
   entity that is responsible for maintaining the numbers in subsequent\
   fields.  GID encodings include a fourth field, the header, to\
   guarantee uniqueness in the namespace defined by EPC.\
\
   Some of the RFID types depend on the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)\
   code defined in the EAN.UCC General Specifications [EANUCCGS].  A\
   GTIN identifies a particular class of object, such as a particular\
   kind of product or SKU.\
\
   The EPC encoding scheme for SGTIN permits the direct embedding of\
   EAN.UCC System standard GTIN and Serial Number codes on EPC tags.  In\
   all cases, the check digit is not encoded.  Two encoding schemes are\
   specified, SGTIN-64 (64 bits) and SGTIN-96 (96 bits).\
\
   The Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) is defined by the EAN.UCC\
   Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the SSCC is already intended for\
   assignment to individual objects and therefore does not require\
   additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  Two encoding\
   schemes are specified, SSCC-64 (64 bits) and SSCC-96 (96 bits).\
\
   The Global Location Number (GLN) is defined by the EAN.UCC\
   Specifications.  A GLN can represent either a discrete, unique\
   physical location such as a warehouse slot, or an aggregate physical\
   location such as an entire warehouse.  In addition, a GLN can\
   represent a logical entity that performs a business function such as\
   placing an order.  The Serialized Global Location Number (SGLN)\
   includes the Company Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.\
\
   The Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI) is defined by the\
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GRAI is already\
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not\
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The\
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix, Asset Type, and Serial Number.\
\
   The Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI) is defined by the\
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GIAI is already\
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not\
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The\
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix and Individual Asset Reference.\

\
\
   The DoD Construct identifier is defined by the United States\
   Department of Defense (DoD).  This tag data construct may be used to\
   encode tags for shipping goods to the DoD by a supplier who has\
   already been assigned a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.\
\
A.1.1.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-64 Type\
\
   The RFID-SGTIN-64 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The\
   SGTIN-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value (additional data\
   that is used for fast filtering and preselection), Company Prefix\
   Index, Item Reference, and Serial Number.  Only a limited number of\
   Company Prefixes can be represented in the 64-bit tag.\
\
A.1.2.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-96 Type\
\
   The RFID-SGTIN-96 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The\
   SGTIN-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition (an\
   indication of where the subsequent Company Prefix and Item Reference\
   numbers are divided), Company Prefix Index, Item Reference, and\
   Serial Number.\
\
A.1.3.  Description of the RFID-SSCC-64 Type\
\
   The RFID-SSCC-64 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The\
   SSCC-64 includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix\
   Index, and Serial Reference.  Only a limited number of Company\
   Prefixes can be represented in the 64-bit tag.\
\
A.1.4.  Description of the RFID-SSCC-96 Type\
\
   The RFID-SSCC-96 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The\
   SSCC-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company\
   Prefix, and Serial Reference, as well as 24 bits that remain\
   unallocated and must be zero.\
\
A.1.5.  Description of the RFID-SGLN-64 Type\
\
   The RFID-SGLN-64 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The\
   SGLN-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix\
   Index, Location Reference, and Serial Number.\
\
A.1.6.  Description of the RFID-SGLN-96 Type\
\
   The RFID-SGLN-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The\
   SGLN-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company\
   Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.\

\
   The RFID-DoD-64 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The\
   DoD-64 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government\
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.\
\
A.1.12.  Description of the RFID-DoD-96 Type\
\
   The RFID-DoD-96 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The\
   DoD-96 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government\
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.\
\
A.1.13.  Description of the RFID URI Types\
\
   In some cases, it is desirable to encode in URI form a specific\
   encoding of an RFID tag.  For example, an application may prefer a\
   URI representation for report preparation.  Applications that wish to\
   manipulate any additional data fields on tags may need some\
   representation other than the pure identity forms.\
\
   For this purpose, the fields as represented in previous sections are\
   associated with specified fields in the various URI types.  For\
   instance, the URI may have fields such as CompanyPrefix,\

         Negotiating Human Language in Real-Time Communications\
\
Abstract\
\
   Users have various human (i.e., natural) language needs, abilities,\
   and preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.\
   This document defines new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-\
   level attributes so that when establishing interactive communication\
   sessions ("calls"), it is possible to negotiate (i.e., communicate\
   and match) the caller's language and media needs with the\
   capabilities of the called party.  This is especially important for\
   emergency calls, because it allows for a call to be handled by a call\
   taker capable of communicating with the user or for a translator or\
   relay operator to be bridged into the call during setup.  However,\
   this also applies to non-emergency calls (for example, calls to a\
   company call center).\
\
   This document describes the need as well as a solution that uses new\
   SDP media attributes.\

RFC 8373               Negotiating Human Language               May 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   A mutually comprehensible language is helpful for human\
   communication.  This document addresses the negotiation of human\
   language and media modality (spoken, signed, or written) in real-time\
   communications.  A companion document [RFC8255] addresses language\
   selection in email.\
\
   Unless the caller and callee know each other or there is contextual\
   or out-of-band information from which the language(s) and media\
   modalities can be determined, there is a need for spoken, signed, or\
   written languages to be negotiated based on the caller's needs and\
   the callee's capabilities.  This need applies to both emergency and\
   non-emergency calls.  An example of a non-emergency call is when a\
   caller contacts a company call center; an emergency call typically\
   involves a caller contacting a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).\
   In such scenarios, it is helpful for the caller to be able to\
   indicate preferred signed, written, and/or spoken languages and for\
   the callee to be able to indicate its capabilities; this allows the\
   call to proceed using the language(s) and media forms supported by\
   both.\
\
   For various reasons, including the ability to establish multiple\
   streams using different media (i.e., voice, text, and/or video), it\
   makes sense to use a per-stream negotiation mechanism known as the\
   Session Description Protocol (SDP).  Utilizing SDP [RFC4566] enables\
   the solution described in this document to be applied to all\
   interactive communications negotiated using SDP, in emergency as well\
   as non-emergency scenarios.\
\
   By treating language as another SDP attribute that is negotiated\
   along with other aspects of a media stream, it becomes possible to\
   accommodate a range of users' needs and called-party facilities.  For\
   example, some users may be able to speak several languages but have a\
   preference.  Some called parties may support some of those languages\
   internally but require the use of a translation service for others,\
   or they may have a limited number of call takers able to use certain\
   languages.  Another example would be a user who is able to speak but\
   is deaf or hard of hearing and desires a voice stream to send spoken\
   language plus a text stream to receive written language.  Making\
   language a media attribute allows standard session negotiation to\
   handle this by providing the information and mechanism for the\
   endpoints to make appropriate decisions.\
\
   The term "negotiation" is used here rather than "indication" because\
   human language (spoken/written/signed) can be negotiated in the same\
   manner as media (audio/text/video) and codecs.  For example, if we\
   think of a user calling an airline reservation center, the user may\

\
\
   be able to use a set of languages, perhaps with preferences for one\
   or a few, while the airline reservation center may support a fixed\
   set of languages.  Negotiation should select the user's most\
   preferred language that is supported by the call center.  Both sides\
   should be aware of which language was negotiated.\
\
   In the offer/answer model used here, the offer contains a set of\
   languages per media (and direction) that the offerer is capable of\
   using, and the answer contains one language per media (and direction)\
   that the answerer will support.  Supporting languages and/or\
   modalities can require taking extra steps, such as bridging external\
   translation or relay resources into the call or having a call handled\
   by an agent who speaks a requested language and/or has the ability to\
   use a requested modality.  The answer indicates the media and\
   languages that the answerer is committing to support (possibly after\
   additional steps have been taken).  This model also provides\
   knowledge so both ends know what has been negotiated.  Note that\
   additional steps required to support the indicated languages or\
   modalities may or may not be in place in time for any early media.\
\
   Since this is a protocol mechanism, the user equipment (UE) client\
   needs to know the user's preferred languages; while this document\
   does not address how clients determine this, reasonable techniques\
   could include a configuration mechanism with a default of the\
   language of the user interface.  In some cases, a UE client could tie\
   language and media preferences, such as a preference for a video\
   stream using a signed language and/or a text or audio stream using a\
   written/spoken language.\
\
   This document does not address user interface (UI) issues, such as if\
   or how a UE client informs a user about the result of language and\
   media negotiation.\
\
1.1.  Applicability\
\
   Within this document, it is assumed that the negotiating endpoints\
   have already been determined so that a per-stream negotiation based\
   on SDP can proceed.\
\
   When setting up interactive communication sessions, it is necessary\
   to route signaling messages to the appropriate endpoint(s).  This\
   document does not address the problem of language-based routing.\

\
\
2.  Terminology\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
3.  Desired Semantics\
\
   The desired solution is a media attribute (preferably per direction)\
   that may be used within an offer to indicate the preferred\
   language(s) of each (direction of a) media stream and within an\
   answer to indicate the accepted language.  When multiple languages\
   are included for a media stream within an offer, the languages are\
   listed in order of preference (most preferred first).\
\
   Note that negotiating multiple simultaneous languages within a media\
   stream is out of scope of this document.\
\
4.  The Existing 'lang' Attribute\
\
   RFC 4566 [RFC4566] specifies an attribute 'lang' that is similar to\
   what is needed here but is not sufficiently specific or flexible for\
   the needs of this document.  In addition, 'lang' is not mentioned in\
   [RFC3264], and there are no known implementations in SIP.  Further,\
   it is useful to be able to specify language per direction (sending\
   and receiving).  This document therefore defines two new attributes.\
\
5.  Solution\
\
   An SDP attribute (per direction) seems the natural choice to\
   negotiate human language of an interactive media stream, using the\
   language tags of [BCP47].\
\
5.1.  The 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' Attributes\
\
   This document defines two media-level attributes: 'hlang-send' and\
   'hlang-recv' (registered in Section 6).  Both start with 'hlang',\
   short for "human language".  These attributes are used to negotiate\
   which human language is selected for use in (each direction of) each\
   interactive media stream.  (Note that not all streams will\
   necessarily be used.)  Each can appear for media streams in offers\
   and answers.\
\
   In an offer, the 'hlang-send' value is a list of one or more\
   language(s) the offerer is willing to use when sending using the\
   media, and the 'hlang-recv' value is a list of one or more\
\
\
\

\
RFC 8373               Negotiating Human Language               May 2018\
\
\
   language(s) the offerer is willing to use when receiving using the\
   media.  The list of languages is in preference order (first is most\
   preferred).  When a media is intended for interactive communication\
   in only one direction (e.g., a user in France with difficulty\
   speaking but able to hear who indicates a desire to receive French\
   using audio and send French using text), either 'hlang-send' or\
   'hlang-recv' MAY be omitted.  Note that the media can still be useful\
   in both directions.  When a media is not primarily intended for\
   language (for example, a video or audio stream intended for\
   background only), both SHOULD be omitted.  Otherwise, both SHOULD\
   have the same value.  Note that specifying different languages for\
   each direction (as opposed to the same, or essentially the same,\
   language in different modalities) can make it difficult to complete\
   the call (e.g., specifying a desire to send audio in Hungarian and\
   receive audio in Portuguese).\
\
   In an answer, 'hlang-send' is the language the answerer will send if\
   using the media for language (which in most cases is one of the\
   languages in the offer's 'hlang-recv'), and 'hlang-recv' is the\
   language the answerer expects to receive if using the media for\
   language (which in most cases is one of the languages in the offer's\
   'hlang-send').\
\
   In an offer, each value MUST be a list of one or more language tags\
   per [BCP47], separated by white space.  In an answer, each value MUST\
   be one language tag per [BCP47].  [BCP47] describes mechanisms for\
   matching language tags.  Note that Section 4.1 of RFC 5646 [BCP47]\
   advises to "tag content wisely" and not include unnecessary subtags.\
\
   When placing an emergency call, and in any other case where the\
   language cannot be inferred from context, each OFFERed media stream\
   primarily intended for human language communication SHOULD specify\
   the 'hlang-send' and/or 'hlang-recv' attributes for the direction(s)\
   intended for interactive communication.\
\
   Clients acting on behalf of end users are expected to set one or both\
   of the 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' attributes on each OFFERed media\
   stream primarily intended for human communication when placing an\
   outgoing session, and either ignore or take into consideration the\
   attributes when receiving incoming calls, based on local\
   configuration and capabilities.  Systems acting on behalf of call\
   centers and PSAPs are expected to take the attributes into account\
   when processing inbound calls.\
\
   Note that media and language negotiation might result in more media\
   streams being accepted than are needed by the users (e.g., if more\
   preferred and less preferred combinations of media and language are\
   all accepted).  This is not a problem.\

\
\
5.2.  No Language in Common\
\
   A consideration regarding the ability to negotiate language is\
   whether the call proceeds or fails if the callee does not support any\
   of the languages requested by the caller.  This document does not\
   mandate either behavior.\
\
   When a call is rejected due to lack of any language in common, the\
   SIP response has SIP response code 488 (Not Acceptable Here) or 606\
   (Not Acceptable) [RFC3261] and a Warning header field [RFC3261] with\
   a warning code of 308 and warning text indicating that there are no\
   mutually supported languages; the warning text SHOULD also contain\
   the supported languages and media.\
\
   Example:\
\
   Warning:  308 proxy.example.com  "Incompatible language\
      specification: Requested languages not supported.  Supported\
      languages are: es, en; supported media are: audio, text."\
\
5.3.  Usage Notes\
\
   A sign-language tag with a video media stream is interpreted as an\
   indication for sign language in the video stream.  A non-sign-\
   language tag with a text media stream is interpreted as an indication\
   for written language in the text stream.  A non-sign-language tag\
   with an audio media stream is interpreted as an indication for spoken\
   language in the audio stream.\
\
   This document does not define any other use for language tags in\
   video media (such as how to indicate visible captions in the video\
   stream).\
\
   This document does not define the use of sign-language tags in text\
   or audio media.\
\
   In the IANA registry for language subtags per [BCP47], a language\
   subtag with a Type field "extlang" combined with a Prefix field value\
   "sgn" indicates a sign-language tag.  The absence of such "sgn"\
   prefix indicates a non-sign-language tag.\
\
   This document does not define the use of language tags in media other\
   than interactive streams of audio, video, and text (such as "message"\
   or "application").  Such use could be supported by future work or by\
   application agreement.\

\
   Note that, even though the examples show the same (or essentially the\
   same) language being used in both directions (even when the modality\
   differs), there is no requirement that this be the case.  However, in\
   practice, doing so is likely to increase the chances of successful\
   matching.\

6.  IANA Considerations\
\
6.1.  att-field Subregistry of SDP Parameters\
\
   The syntax in this section uses ABNF per RFC 5234 [RFC5234].\
\
   IANA has added two entries to the "att-field (media level only)"\
   subregistry of the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters"\
   registry.\
\
   The first entry is for 'hlang-recv':\
\
   Attribute Name:          hlang-recv\
   Long-Form English Name:  human language receive\
   Contact Name:            Randall Gellens\
   Contact Email Address:   rg+ietf@coretechnologyconsulting.com\
   Attribute Value:         hlang-value\
   Attribute Syntax:\
      hlang-value =  hlang-offv / hlang-ansv\
         ; hlang-offv used in offers\
         ; hlang-ansv used in answers\
      hlang-offv  =  Language-Tag *( SP Language-Tag )\
         ; Language-Tag as defined in [BCP47]\
      SP          =  1*" " ; one or more space (%x20) characters\
      hlang-ansv  =  Language-Tag\

   Reference:               RFC 8373\
\
6.2.  Warning Codes Subregistry of SIP Parameters\
\
   IANA has added the value 308 to the "Warning Codes (warn-codes)"\
   subregistry of the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters"\
   registry.  (The value lies within the range allocated for indicating\
   problems with keywords in the session description.)  The reference is\
   to this document.  The warn text is "Incompatible language\
   specification: Requested languages not supported.  Supported\
   languages are [list of supported languages]; supported media are:\
   [list of supported media]."\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   The Security Considerations of [BCP47] apply here.  An attacker with\
   the ability to modify signaling could prevent a call from succeeding\
   by altering any of several crucial elements, including the\
   'hlang-send' or 'hlang-recv' values.  RFC 5069 [RFC5069] discusses\
   such threats.  Use of TLS or IPsec can protect against such threats.\
   Emergency calls are of particular concern; RFC 6881 [RFC6881], which\
   is specific to emergency calls, mandates use of TLS or IPsec (in\
   ED-57/SP-30).\
\
8.  Privacy Considerations\
\
   Language and media information can suggest a user's nationality,\
   background, abilities, disabilities, etc.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This document discusses the aspects that need to be considered when\
   developing a solution for MPLS flow identification.  The key\
   application that needs this is in-band performance monitoring of MPLS\
   flows when MPLS is used to encapsulate user data packets.\
\
   There is a need to identify flows in MPLS networks for various\
   applications such as determining packet loss and packet delay\
   measurement.  A method of loss and delay measurement in MPLS networks\
   was defined in [RFC6374].  When used to measure packet loss,\
   [RFC6374] depends on the use of injected Operations, Administration,\
   and Maintenance (OAM) packets to designate the beginning and the end\
   of the packet group over which packet loss is being measured.  If the\
   misordering of packets from one group relative to the following group\

\
\
   or the misordering of any of the packets being counted relative to\
   the Loss Measurement packet [RFC6374] occurs, then an error will\
   occur in the packet loss measurement.\
\
   In addition, [RFC6374] did not support different granularities of\
   flow or address a number of multipoint cases in which two or more\
   ingress Label Switching Routers (LSRs) could send packets to one or\
   more destinations.\
\
   Due to the very low loss rate in normal operation, improvements in\
   link and transmission technologies have made it more difficult to\
   assess packet loss using active performance measurement methods with\
   synthetic traffic.  That, together with more demanding service-level\
   requirements, means that network operators now need to be able to\
   measure the loss of the actual user data traffic using passive\
   performance measurement methods.  Any technique deployed needs to be\
   transparent to the end user, and it needs to be assumed that they\
   will not take any active part in the measurement process.  Indeed, it\
   is important that any flow identification technique be invisible to\
   them and that no remnant of the measurement process leaks into their\
   network.\
\
   Additionally, when there are multiple traffic sources, such as in\
   multipoint-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint network\
   environments, there needs to be a method whereby the sink can\
   distinguish between packets from the various sources; that is to say,\
   a multipoint measurement model needs to be developed.\
\
2.  Loss Measurement Considerations\
\
   Modern networks, if not oversubscribed, generally drop relatively few\
   packets; thus, packet loss measurement is highly sensitive to the\
   common demarcation of the exact set of packets to be measured for\
   loss.  Without some form of coloring or batch marking such as that\
   proposed in [RFC8321], it may not be possible to achieve the required\
   accuracy in the loss measurement of customer data traffic.  Thus,\
   when accurate measurement of packet loss is required, it may be\
   economically advantageous, or even be a technical requirement, to\
   include some form of marking in the packets to assign each packet to\
   a particular counter for loss measurement purposes.\
\
   When this level of accuracy is required and the traffic between a\
   source-destination pair is subject to Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP), a\
   demarcation mechanism is needed to group the packets into batches.\
   Once a batch is correlated at both ingress and egress, the packet\
   accounting mechanism is then able to operate on the batch of packets\
   that can be accounted for at both the packet ingress and the packet\
\

RFC 8372                MPLS Flow Identification                May 2018\
\
\
   egress.  Errors in the accounting are particularly acute in Label\
   Switched Paths (LSPs) subjected to ECMP because the network transit\
   time will be different for the various ECMP paths since:\
\
   1.  the packets may traverse different sets of LSRs;\
\
   2.  the packets may depart from different interfaces on different\
       line cards on LSRs; and\
\
   3.  the packets may arrive at different interfaces on different line\
       cards on LSRs.\
\
   A consideration with this solution on modifying the identity label\
   (the MPLS label ordinarily used to identify the LSP, Virtual Private\
   Network, Pseudowire, etc.) to indicate the batch is the impact that\
   this has on the path chosen by the ECMP mechanism.  When the member\
   of the ECMP path set is chosen by deep packet inspection, a change of\
   batch represented by a change of identity label will have no impact\
   on the ECMP path.  If the path member is chosen by reference to an\
   entropy label [RFC6790], then changing the batch identifier will not\
   result in a change to the chosen ECMP path.  ECMP is so pervasive in\
   multipoint-to-(multi)point networks that some method of avoiding\
   accounting errors introduced by ECMP needs to be supported.\
\
3.  Delay Measurement Considerations\
\
   Most of the existing delay measurement methods are active methods\
   that depend on the extra injected test packet to evaluate the delay\
   of a path.  With the active measurement method, the rate, numbers,\
   and interval between the injected packets may affect the accuracy of\
   the results.  Due to ECMP (or link aggregation techniques), injected\
   test packets may traverse different links from the ones used by the\
   data traffic.  Thus, measuring the delay of the real traffic is\
   required.\
\
   For combined loss and delay measurements, both the loss and the delay\
   considerations apply.\
\
4.  Units of Identification\
\
   The most basic unit of identification is the identity of the node\
   that processed the packet on its entry to the MPLS network.  However,\
   the required unit of identification may vary depending on the use\
   case for accounting, performance measurement, or other types of\
   packet observations.  In particular, note that there may be a need to\
   impose identity at several different layers of the MPLS label stack.\

RFC 8372                MPLS Flow Identification                May 2018\
\
\
   This document considers the identification of the following traffic\
   components:\
\
   o  Per source LSR: everything from one source is aggregated\
\
   o  Per group of LSPs chosen by an ingress LSR: an ingress LSP\
      aggregates a group of LSPs (e.g., all the LSPs of a tunnel)\
\
   o  Per LSP: the basic form\
\
   o  Per flow [RFC6790] within an LSP: a fine-grained method\
\
   Note that a fine-grained identity resolution is needed when there is\
   a need to perform these operations on a flow not readily identified\
   by some other element in the label stack.  Such a fine-grained\
   resolution may be possible by deep packet inspection.  However, this\
   may not always be possible, or it may be desired to minimize\
   processing costs by doing this only on entry to the network.  Adding\
   a suitable identifier to the packet for reference by other network\
   elements minimizes the processing needed by other network elements.\
   An example of such a fine-grained case might be traffic belonging to\
   a certain service or from a specific source, particularly if matters\
   related to service level agreement or application performance were\
   being investigated.\
\
   We can thus characterize the identification requirement in the\
   following broad terms:\
\
   o  There needs to be some way for an egress LSR to identify the\
      ingress LSR with an appropriate degree of scope.  This concept is\
      discussed further in Section 6.\
\
   o  There needs to be a way to identify a specific LSP at the egress\
      node.  This allows for the case of instrumenting multiple LSPs\
      operating between the same pair of nodes.  In such cases, the\
      identity of the ingress LSR is insufficient.\
\
   o  In order to conserve resources such as labels, counters, and/or\
      compute cycles, it may be desirable to identify an LSP group so\
      that an operation can be performed on the group as an aggregate.\
\
   o  There needs to be a way to identify a flow within an LSP.  This is\
      necessary when investigating a specific flow that has been\
      aggregated into an LSP.\
\
   The unit of identification and the method of determining which\
   packets constitute a flow will be specific to the application or use\
   case and are out of scope of this document.\

\
\
5.  Types of LSP\
\
   We need to consider a number of types of LSP.  The two simplest types\
   to monitor are point-to-point LSPs and point-to-multipoint LSPs.  The\
   ingress LSR for a point-to-point LSP, such as those created using the\
   Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\
   [RFC5420] signaling protocol or those that conform to the MPLS\
   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [RFC5654], may be identified by\
   inspection of the top label in the stack because, at any provider-\
   edge (PE) or provider (P) router on the path, the top label is unique\
   to the ingress-egress pair at every hop at a given layer in the LSP\
   hierarchy.  Provided that Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) is disabled,\
   the identity of the ingress LSR of a point-to-point LSP is available\
   at the egress LSR; thus, determining the identity of the ingress LSR\
   must be regarded as a solved problem.  Note, however, that the\
   identity of a flow cannot to be determined without further\
   information being carried in the packet or gleaned from some aspect\
   of the packet payload.\
\
   In the case of a point-to-multipoint LSP, and in the absence of PHP,\
   the identity of the ingress LSR may also be inferred from the top\
   label.  However, it may not possible to adequately identify the flow\
   from the top label alone; thus, further information may need to be\
   carried in the packet or gleaned from some aspect of the packet\
   payload.  In designing any solution, it is desirable that a common\
   flow identification solution be used for both point-to-point and\
   point-to-multipoint LSP types.  Similarly, it is desirable that a\
   common method of LSP group identification be used.  In the above\
   cases, a context label [RFC5331] needs to be used to provide the\
   required identity information.  This is a widely supported MPLS\
   feature.\
\
   A more interesting case is the case of a multipoint-to-point LSP.  In\
   this case, the same label is normally used by multiple ingress or\
   upstream LSRs; hence, source identification is not possible by\
   inspection of the top label by the egress LSRs.  It is therefore\
   necessary for a packet to be able to explicitly convey any of the\
   identity types described in Section 4.\
\
   Similarly, in the case of a multipoint-to-multipoint LSP, the same\
   label is normally used by multiple ingress or upstream LSRs; hence,\
   source identification is not possible by inspection of the top label\
   by egress LSRs.  The various identity types described in Section 4\
   are again needed.  Note, however, that the scope of the identity may\
   be constrained to be unique within the set of multipoint-to-\
   multipoint LSPs terminating on any common node.\

\
\
6.  Network Scope\
\
   The scope of identification can be constrained to the set of flows\
   that are uniquely identifiable at an ingress LSR or some aggregation\
   thereof.  There is no need for an ingress LSR to seek assistance from\
   outside the MPLS protocol domain.\
\
   In any solution that constrains itself to carrying the required\
   identity in the MPLS label stack rather than in some different\
   associated data structure, constraints on the choice of label and\
   label stack size imply that the scope of identity resides within that\
   MPLS domain.  For similar reasons, the identity scope of a component\
   of an LSP is constrained to the scope of that LSP.\
\
7.  Backwards Compatibility\
\
   In any network, it is unlikely that all LSRs will have the same\
   capability to support the methods of identification discussed in this\
   document.  It is therefore an important constraint on any flow\
   identity solution that it is backwards compatible with deployed MPLS\
   equipment to the extent that deploying the new feature will not\
   disable anything that currently works on the legacy equipment.\
\
   This is particularly the case when the deployment is incremental or\
   the feature is not required for all LSRs or all LSPs.  Thus, the flow\
   identification design must support the coexistence of LSRs that can\
   identify the traffic components described in Section 4 and those that\
   cannot.  In addition, the identification of the traffic components\
   described in Section 4 must be an optional feature that is disabled\
   by default.  As a design simplification, a solution may require that\
   all egress LSRs of a point-to-multipoint or a multipoint-to-\
   multipoint LSP support the identification type in use so that a\
   single packet can be correctly processed by all egress devices.  The\
   corollary of this last point is that either all egress LSRs are\
   enabled to support the required identity type or none of them are.\
\
8.  Data Plane\
\
   There is a huge installed base of MPLS equipment; typically, this\
   type of equipment remains in service for an extended period of time,\
   and in many cases, hardware constraints mean that it is not possible\
   to upgrade its data-plane functionality.  Changes to the MPLS data\
   plane are therefore expensive to implement, add complexity to the\
   network, and may significantly impact the deployability of a solution\
   that requires such changes.  For these reasons, MPLS users have set a\
   very high bar to changes to the MPLS data plane, and only a very\
   small number have been adopted.  Hence, it is important that the\
   method of identification must minimize changes to the MPLS data\
\
\

RFC 8372                MPLS Flow Identification                May 2018\
\
\
   plane.  Ideally, method(s) of identification that require no changes\
   to the MPLS data plane should be given preferential consideration.\
   If a method of identification that makes a change to the data plane\
   is chosen, it will need to have a significant advantage over any\
   method that makes no change, and the advantage of the approach will\
   need to be carefully evaluated and documented.  If a change to the\
   MPLS data plane proves necessary, it should be (a) as small a change\
   as possible and (b) a general-purpose method, so as to maximize its\
   use for future applications.  It is imperative that, as far as can be\
   foreseen, any necessary change made to the MPLS data plane does not\
   impose any foreseeable future limitation on the MPLS data plane.\
\
   Stack size is an issue with many MPLS implementations both as a\
   result of hardware limitations and due to the impact on networks and\
   applications in which a large number of small payloads need to be\
   transported.  In particular, one MPLS payload may be carried inside\
   another.  For example, one LSP may be carried over another LSP, or a\
   Pseudowire (PW) or similar multiplexing construct may be carried over\
   an LSP, and identification may be required at both layers.  Of\
   particular concern is the implementation of low-cost edge LSRs that,\
   for cost reasons, have a significant limit on the number of Label\
   Stack Entries (LSEs) that they can impose or dispose.  Therefore, any\
   method of identity must not consume an excessive number of unique\
   labels and must not result in an excessive increase in the size of\
   the label stack.\
\
   The design of the MPLS data plane provides two types of special-\
   purpose labels: the original 16 reserved labels and the much larger\
   set of special-purpose labels defined in [RFC7274].  The original\
   reserved labels need one LSE, and the newer special-purpose labels\
   [RFC7274] need two LSEs.  Given the tiny number of original reserved\
   labels, it is core to the MPLS design philosophy that this scarce\
   resource is only used when it is absolutely necessary.  Using a\
   special-purpose label to encode flow identity requires two label\
   stack entries, one for the reserved label and one for the flow\
   identity.  Use of extended special-purpose labels [RFC7274] requires\
   a total of three label stack entries to encode the flow identity.\
   The larger set of [RFC7274] labels requires two label stack entries\
   for the special-purpose label itself; hence, a total of three label\
   stack entries is needed to encode the flow identity.\
\
   The use of special-purpose labels [RFC7274] as part of a method to\
   encode the identity information therefore has a number of undesirable\
   implications for the data plane.  Thus, while a solution may use\
   special-purpose labels, methods that do not require special-purpose\
   labels need to be carefully considered.\

   Any flow identity design should both seek to minimize the complexity\
   of the control plane and minimize the amount of label coordination\
   needed amongst LSRs.\
\
10.  Privacy Considerations\
\
   The inclusion of originating and/or flow information in a packet\
   provides more identity information and hence potentially degrades the\
   privacy of the communication.\
\
   Recent IETF concerns on pervasive monitoring [RFC7258] have resulted\
   in a preference for a solution that does not degrade the privacy of\
   user traffic below that of an MPLS network not implementing the flow\
   identification feature.  The choice of using MPLS technology for this\
   OAM solution has a privacy advantage, as the choice of the label\
   identifying a flow is limited to the scope of the MPLS domain and\
   does not have any dependency on the identification of the user data.\
   This minimizes the observability of the flow characteristics.\
\
11.  Security Considerations\
\
   Any flow identification solution must not degrade the security of the\
   MPLS network below that of an equivalent network not deploying the\
   specified identity solution.  In order to preserve present\
   assumptions about MPLS privacy properties, propagation of\
   identification information outside the MPLS network imposing it must\
   be disabled by default.  Any solution should provide for the\
   restriction of the identity information to those components of the\
   network that need to know it.  It is thus desirable to limit the\
   knowledge of the identify of an endpoint to only those LSRs that need\
   to participate in traffic flow.  The choice of using MPLS technology\
   for this OAM solution, with MPLS encapsulation of user traffic,\
   provides for a key advantage over other data-plane solutions, as it\
   provides for a controlled access and trusted domain within a service\
   provider's network.\

   mitigation techniques, please see "Security Framework for MPLS and\
   GMPLS Networks" [RFC5920].\

Abstract\
\
   This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain\
   Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending with\
   '.home.arpa.' and designates this domain as a special-use domain\
   name. 'home.arpa.' is designated for non-unique use in residential\
   home networks.  The Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) is\
   updated to use the 'home.arpa.' domain instead of '.home'.\

RFC 8375                       home.arpa.                       May 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Users and devices within a home network (hereafter referred to as\
   "homenet") require devices and services to be identified by names\
   that are unique within the boundaries of the homenet [RFC7368].  The\
   naming mechanism needs to function without configuration from the\
   user.  While it may be possible for a name to be delegated by an ISP,\
   homenets must also function in the absence of such a delegation.\
   This document reserves the name 'home.arpa.' to serve as the default\
   name for this purpose, with a scope limited to each individual\
   homenet.\
\
   This document corrects an error in [RFC7788] by replacing '.home'\
   with 'home.arpa.' as the default domain name for homenets. '.home'\
   was selected as the most user-friendly option; however, there are\
   existing uses of '.home' that may be in conflict with this use.\
   Evidence indicates that '.home' queries frequently leak out and reach\
   the root name servers [ICANN1] [ICANN2].\
\
   In addition, for compatibility with DNSSEC (see Section 6), it's\
   necessary that an insecure delegation (see Section 4.3 of [RFC4035])\
   be present for the name.  There is an existing process for allocating\
   names under '.arpa.'  [RFC3172].  No such process is available for\
   requesting a similar delegation in the root at the request of the\
   IETF, which does not administer that zone.  As a result, all\
   unregistered uses of '.home' (that is, all current uses at the time\
   of this document's publication), particularly as specified in\
   [RFC7788], are deprecated.\
\
   This document registers the domain 'home.arpa.' as a special-use\
   domain name [RFC6761] and specifies the behavior that is expected\
   from the Domain Name System with regard to DNS queries for names\
   whose rightmost non-terminal labels are 'home.arpa.'.  Queries for\
   names ending with '.home.arpa.' are of local significance within the\
   scope of a homenet, meaning that identical queries will result in\
   different results from one homenet to another.  In other words, a\
   name ending in '.home.arpa.' is not globally unique.\
\
   Although this document makes specific reference to [RFC7788], it is\
   not intended that the use of 'home.arpa.' be restricted solely to\
   networks where HNCP is deployed.  Rather, 'home.arpa.' is intended to\
   be the correct domain for uses like the one described for '.home' in\
   [RFC7788]: local name service in residential homenets.\

RFC 8375                       home.arpa.                       May 2018\
\
\
2.  Requirements Language\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
3.  General Guidance\
\
   The domain name 'home.arpa.' is to be used for naming within\
   residential homenets.  Names ending with '.home.arpa.' reference a\
   zone that is served locally, the contents of which are unique only to\
   a particular homenet and are not globally unique.  Such names refer\
   to nodes and/or services that are located within a homenet (e.g., a\
   printer or a toaster).\
\
   DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are resolved using\
   local resolvers on the homenet.  Such queries MUST NOT be recursively\
   forwarded to servers outside the logical boundaries of the homenet.\
\
   Some service discovery user interfaces that are expected to be used\
   on homenets conceal information such as domain names from end users.\
   However, in some cases, it is still expected that users will need to\
   see, remember, and even type names ending with '.home.arpa.'.  The\
   Homenet Working Group hopes that this name will in some way indicate\
   to as many readers as possible that such domain names are referring\
   to devices in the home, but we recognize that it is an imperfect\
   solution.\
\
4.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations\
\
   This section specifies considerations for systems involved in domain\
   name resolution when resolving queries for names ending with\
   '.home.arpa.'.  Each item in this section addresses some aspect of\
   the DNS or the process of resolving domain names that would be\
   affected by this special-use allocation.  Detailed explanations of\
   these items can be found in Section 5 of [RFC6761].  Although the\
   term 'homenet' in [RFC7788] refers to home networks that implement a\
   particular set of features, in this document the term is used to mean\
   any home network, regardless of the set of features it implements.\
\
   1.  Users can use names ending with '.home.arpa.' just as they would\
       use any other domain name.  The 'home.arpa.' name is chosen to be\
       readily recognized by users as signifying that the name is\
       addressing a service on the homenet to which the user's device is\
       connected.\

RFC 8375                       home.arpa.                       May 2018\
\
\
   2.  Application software SHOULD NOT treat names ending in\
       '.home.arpa.' differently than other names.  In particular, there\
       is no basis for trusting names that are subdomains of\
       'home.arpa.' (see Section 6).\
\
   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST NOT recognize names that\
       end in '.home.arpa.' as special and MUST NOT treat them as having\
       special significance, except that it may be necessary that such\
       APIs not bypass the locally configured recursive resolvers.\
\
       One or more IP addresses for recursive DNS servers will usually\
       be supplied to the client through router advertisements or DHCP.\
       For an administrative domain that uses subdomains of\
       'home.arpa.', such as a homenet, the recursive resolvers provided\
       by that domain will be able to answer queries for subdomains of\
       'home.arpa.'; other resolvers will not, or they will provide\
       answers that are not correct within that administrative domain.\
\
       A host that is configured to use a resolver other than one that\
       has been provided by the local network may be unable to resolve,\
       or may receive incorrect results for, subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.\
       In order to avoid this, it is permissible that hosts use the\
       resolvers that are locally provided for resolving 'home.arpa.',\
       even when they are configured to use other resolvers.\
\
   4.  There are three considerations for recursive resolvers that\
       follow this specification:\
\
       A.  Recursive resolvers at sites using 'home.arpa.'  MUST\
           transparently support DNSSEC queries: queries for DNSSEC\
           records and queries with the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit set (see\
           Section 3.2.1 of [RFC4035]).  While validation is not\
           required, it is strongly encouraged: a caching recursive\
           resolver that does not validate answers that can be validated\
           may cache invalid data.  This, in turn, will prevent\
           validating stub resolvers from successfully validating\
           answers.\
\
       B.  Unless configured otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS\
           proxies MUST behave as described in Section 3 of the Locally\
           Served Zones document [RFC6303].  That is, queries for\
           'home.arpa.' and subdomains of 'home.arpa.'  MUST NOT be\
           forwarded, with one important exception: a query for a DS\
           record with the DO bit set MUST return the correct answer for\
           that question, including correct information in the authority\
           section that proves that the record is nonexistent.\
\
\
\
\
\
Pfister & Lemon              Standards Track                    [Page 5]\

RFC 8375                       home.arpa.                       May 2018\
\
\
           So, for example, a query for the NS record for 'home.arpa.'\
           MUST NOT result in that query being forwarded to an upstream\
           cache nor to the authoritative DNS server for '.arpa.'.\
           However, as necessary to provide accurate authority\
           information, a query for the DS record MUST result in\
           forwarding whatever queries are necessary; typically, this\
           will just be a query for the DS record, since the necessary\
           authority information will be included in the authority\
           section of the response if the DO bit is set.\
\
       C.  In addition to the behavior specified above, recursive\
           resolvers that can be used in a homenet MUST be configurable\
           to forward queries for 'home.arpa.' and subdomains of\
           'home.arpa.' to an authoritative server for 'home.arpa.'.\
           This server will provide authoritative data for 'home.arpa.'\
           within a particular homenet.  The special handling for DS\
           records for the 'home.arpa.' delegation is still required.\
\
           It is permissible to combine the recursive resolver function\
           for general DNS lookups with an authoritative resolver for\
           'home.arpa.'; in this case, rather than forwarding queries\
           for subdomains of 'home.arpa.' to an authoritative server,\
           the resolver answers them authoritatively.  The behavior with\
           respect to forwarding queries specifically for 'home.arpa.'\
           remains the same.\
\
   5.  No special processing of 'home.arpa.' is required for\
       authoritative DNS server implementations.  It is possible that an\
       authoritative DNS server might attempt to check the authoritative\
       servers for 'home.arpa.' for a delegation beneath that name\
       before answering authoritatively for such a delegated name.  In\
       such a case, because the name always has only local significance,\
       there will be no such delegation in the 'home.arpa.' zone, and so\
       the server would refuse to answer authoritatively for such a\
       zone.  A server that implements this sort of check MUST be\
       configurable so that either it does not do this check for the\
       'home.arpa.' domain or it ignores the results of the check.\
\
   6.  DNS server operators MAY configure an authoritative server for\
       'home.arpa.' for use in homenets and other home networks.  The\
       operator for the DNS servers authoritative for 'home.arpa.' in\
       the global DNS will configure any such servers as described in\
       Section 7.\
\
   7.  'home.arpa.' is a subdomain of the 'arpa' top-level domain, which\
       is operated by IANA under the authority of the Internet\
       Architecture Board according to the rules established in\
       [RFC3172].  There are no other registrars for '.arpa'.\

RFC 8375                       home.arpa.                       May 2018\
\
\
5.  Updates to Home Networking Control Protocol\
\
   The final paragraph in Section 8 of [RFC7788], the Home Networking\
   Control Protocol, is updated as follows:\
\
   OLD:\
      Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide\
      naming and service discovery with local significance.  A network-\
      wide zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in\
      order to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however, an\
      administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV\
      (Section 10.6) for the network to use a different one.  In case\
      multiple are announced, the domain of the node with the greatest\
      node identifier takes precedence.\
\
   NEW:\
      Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide\
      naming and service discovery with local significance.  A network-\
      wide zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in\
      order to qualify them. 'home.arpa.' is the default; however, an\
      administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV\
      (Section 10.6) for the network to use a different one.  In case\
      multiple TLVs are announced, the domain of the node with the\
      greatest node identifier takes precedence.\
\
      The 'home.arpa.' special-use name does not require a special\
      resolution protocol.  Names for which the rightmost two labels are\
      'home.arpa.' are resolved using the DNS protocol [RFC1035].\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
6.1.  Local Significance\
\
   A DNS record that is returned as a response to a query for a Fully\
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that is a subdomain of 'home.arpa.' is\
   expected to have local significance.  It is expected to be returned\
   by a server involved in name resolution for the homenet the device is\
   connected in.  However, such a response MUST NOT be considered more\
   trustworthy than a similar response for any other DNS query.\
\
   Because 'home.arpa.' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured\
   using DNSSEC based on the root domain's trust anchor, there is no way\
   to tell, using a standard DNS query, in which homenet scope an answer\
   belongs.  Consequently, users may experience surprising results with\
   such names when roaming to different homenets.\
\
\
\

RFC 8375                       home.arpa.                       May 2018\
\
\
   To prevent this from happening, it could be useful for the resolver\
   on the host to securely differentiate between different homenets and\
   between identical names on different homenets.  However, a mechanism\
   for doing this has not yet been standardized and doing so is out of\
   scope for this document.  It is expected that this will be explored\
   in future work.\
\
   The advice in [RFC6303], Section 7, to install local trust anchors\
   for locally served zones can only work if there is some way of\
   configuring the trust anchor in the host.  Homenet currently\
   specifies no mechanism for configuring such trust anchors.  As a\
   result, while this advice sounds good, it is not practicable.\
\
   Also, although it might be useful to install a trust anchor for a\
   particular instance of 'home.arpa.', it's reasonable to expect that a\
   host with such a trust anchor might, from time to time, connect to\
   more than one network with its own instance of 'home.arpa.'.  Such a\
   host would be unable to access services on any instance of\
   'home.arpa.' other than the one for which a trust anchor was\
   configured.\
\
   It is, in principle, possible to attach an identifier to an instance\
   of 'home.arpa.' that could be used to identify which trust anchor to\
   rely on for validating names in that particular instance.  However,\
   the security implications of this are complicated, and such a\
   mechanism, as well as a discussion of those implications, is out of\
   scope for this document.\
\
6.2.  Insecure Delegation\
\
   It is not possible to install a trust anchor (a DS RR) for this zone\
   in the '.arpa' zone.  The reason for this is that in order to do so,\
   it would be necessary to have the key-signing key for the zone (see\
   Section 5 of [RFC4034]).  Since the zone is not globally unique, no\
   one key would work.\
\
   An alternative would be to provide an authenticated denial of\
   existence (see Section 3.2 of [RFC4033]).  This would be done simply\
   by not having a delegation from the 'arpa.' zone.  However, this\
   requires the validating resolver to treat 'home.arpa.' specially.  If\
   a validating resolver that doesn't treat 'home.arpa.' specially\
   attempts to validate a name in 'home.arpa.', an authenticated denial\
   of existence of 'home' as a subdomain of 'arpa.' would cause the\
   validation to fail.  Therefore, the only delegation that will allow\
   names under 'home.arpa.' to be resolved by all validating resolvers\
   is an insecure delegation, as in Section 7 of [RFC6303].\

RFC 8375                       home.arpa.                       May 2018\
\
\
   Consequently, unless a trust anchor for the particular instance of\
   the 'home.arpa.' zone being validated is manually configured on the\
   validating resolver, DNSSEC signing and validation of names within\
   the 'home.arpa.' zone is not possible.\
\
6.3.  Bypassing Manually Configured Resolvers\
\
   In item 3 of Section 4, an exception is made to the behavior of stub\
   resolvers that allows them to query local resolvers for subdomains of\
   'home.arpa.' even when they have been manually configured to use\
   other resolvers.  This behavior obviously has security and privacy\
   implications and may not be desirable depending on the context.  It\
   may be better to simply ignore this exception and, when one or more\
   recursive resolvers are configured manually, simply fail to provide\
   correct answers for subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.  At this time, we do\
   not have operational experience that would guide us in making this\
   decision; implementors are encouraged to consider the context in\
   which their software will be deployed when deciding how to resolve\
   this question.\
\
7.  Delegation of 'home.arpa.'\
\
   In order to be fully functional, there must be a delegation of\
   'home.arpa.' in the '.arpa.' zone [RFC3172].  This delegation MUST\
   NOT include a DS record and MUST point to one or more black hole\
   servers, for example, 'blackhole-1.iana.org.' and 'blackhole-\
   2.iana.org.'.  The reason that this delegation must not be signed is\
   that not signing the delegation breaks the DNSSEC chain of trust,\
   which prevents a validating stub resolver from rejecting names\
   published under 'home.arpa.' on a homenet name server.\
\
8.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has recorded the domain name 'home.arpa.' in the "Special-Use\
   Domain Names" registry [SUDN].  IANA, with the approval of the IAB,\
   has implemented the delegation requested in Section 7.\
\
   IANA has created a new subregistry within the "Locally-Served DNS\
   Zones" registry [LSDZ], titled "Transport-Independent Locally-Served\
   DNS Zone Registry", with the same format as the other subregistries.\
   IANA has added an entry in this new registry for 'home.arpa.' with\
   the description "Homenet Special-Use Domain", listing this document\
   as the reference.  The registration procedure for this subregistry\
   should be the same as for the others, currently "IETF Review" (see\
   Section 4.8 of [RFC8126]).\

             Internationalizing IPv6 Using 128-Bit Unicode\
\
Abstract\
\
   It is clear that Unicode will eventually exhaust its supply of code\
   points, and more will be needed.  Assuming ISO and the Unicode\
   Consortium follow the practices of the IETF, the next Unicode code\
   point size will be 128 bits.  This document describes how this future\
   128-bit Unicode can be leveraged to improve IPv6 adoption and finally\
   bring internationalization support to IPv6.\

RFC 8369                 Unicode IPv6 Addressing            1 April 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Unicode [Unicode] is currently limited to 1,114,112 code points,\
   encoded in various encoding formats (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32).\
   At the time of this document's publication, 136,755 code points have\
   been allocated, with more already in the approval process.  Every\
   year, more writing scripts, symbols, and emojis are added, while none\
   are removed.  After consulting expert mathematicians, we have\
   determined that the world will run out of code points someday in the\
   future.\
\
   While it might appear that the current rate of code point allocation\
   gives us plenty of time to deal with the exhaustion problem, the\
   Internet's history has shown that popular number spaces do not fill\
   up linearly, but rather exponentially.  And once the size of a\
   particular number space becomes entrenched, it takes decades to\
   migrate to a larger one.  Therefore, the code point number space must\
   be increased as soon as possible.\
\
   The details for expanding the Unicode code point space are not\
   covered in this document.  Such details need to be worked out between\
   the IETF, ISO, the Unicode Consortium, and various gods.  We assume,\
   however, that the code point space will need to grow dramatically,\
   and there will continue to be a need for a fixed-length encoding\
   scheme similar to UTF-32.  Naturally, the next size increment should\
   go from UTF-32 to UTF-128, and thus the rest of this document follows\
   this assumption.\
\
   This new 128-bit Unicode code point space can be leveraged by the\
   IETF to address one of the lingering issues with IPv6: there's not\
   much left to standardize.  With the changes described in this\
   document, the IETF will be kept busy for decades to come.  It also\
   enables new features and market opportunities, to help the global\
   economy.  This in turn will increase tax revenues for governments,\
   which eventually may lead to increased funds for combating global\
   warming.  Therefore, the ultimate goal of this document is to reduce\
   global warming.\
\
1.1.  Requirements Language\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.  All other words SHOULD be interpreted as\
   described by the Oxford English Dictionary OED [OED], which MAY be\
   considered almost as authoritative for word definitions as the IETF.\

1.2.  Definitions\
\
   UTF-128:  A fixed-length encoding for 128-bit Unicode.  It is\
         implemented as an array of bytes in the same manner as legacy\
         IPv6 addresses to avoid endianness issues.\
\
   Short-Name Tag:  A short descriptive name for a Unicode character\
         code point, surrounded by colons (:).  For example ":garfield:"\
         represents the Unicode code point for the Garfield cat imoji.\
\
   Emoji:  Pictographic symbol encoded in Unicode, used to express a\
         general item, concept, or emotion.\
\
   Imoji:  Pictographic symbol encoded in Unicode, used to represent an\
         individual, specific thing: a specific human, a favorite pet, a\
         famous animal, etc.\
\
   Amoji:  Pictographic symbol encoded in Unicode, used to represent an\
         individual of an alien species.\
\
   Umoji:  Pictographic symbol encoded in Unicode, used to represent\
         unknown things not covered by the other mojis.\
\
   Omoji:  Pictographic symbol encoded in Unicode, used to represent\
         obfuscated identities, used as addresses for the purpose of\
         privacy.\
\
2.  The Need for 128-Bit Code Points\
\
   The exponentially increasing demand for Unicode character code points\
   might not be obvious at first glance.  While it is true that the\
   number of languages and their writing scripts do not grow quickly\
   over time, one type of "character" will: emojis.  Unicode has barely\
   begun providing code points for all of the various emojis currently\
   in use, and it is likely that more emojis will be created in the\
   future.  For example, there are still missing emoji symbols for most\
   types of food and drink, the flags of each town and city on Earth,\
   all human sporting and leisure activities including all local and\
   national sports teams and players, and every plant and animal species\
   and gender.\
\
   Furthermore, it has become common for some applications to allow\
   their users to create custom emojis, whereby the user can provide the\
   graphic to display for a new "character".  For example, a user might\
   set their chat application to display a graphic of Carlos Ramirez's\
   popular "Trollface" meme [TROLL], using the short-name tag\
   ':trollface:' in their chat application.  All other users of the same\
   chat app will be able to see and use the same custom trollface emoji.\
\

RFC 8369                 Unicode IPv6 Addressing            1 April 2018\
\
\
   However, since there is no Unicode code point for :trollface:, the\
   chat app cannot export the trollface emoji to other chat apps or\
   protocols, such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC) or the Extensible\
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  This represents a clear\
   interoperability issue.\
\
   In the future, it might also become desirable to assign each human a\
   Unicode code point to represent them, similar to names, with the\
   glyph being a picture of their face or a custom graphic.  These\
   personal code points are not truly "emojis" in the classical sense of\
   being generic concepts, so we've decided to give them a new name to\
   avoid confusion: imoji.  Unlike human names, code points for imojis\
   will be unique per human, for all space and time.  Favorite pets and\
   famous animals can also be assigned imojis.\
\
   Lastly, if we ever encounter sentient species from other planets,\
   they too will need Unicode code points for their writing scripts and\
   emojis; and they will each need unique amojis (imojis for aliens),\
   for whatever form their individual identity might take.  Section 4 of\
   RFC 8136 [RFC8136] clearly supports such a scenario, with the new UFO\
   IPv6 option.\
\
   Based on the above obvious use cases, it is clear that the current ~1\
   million code points are nowhere near enough.  Increasing to 64 bits\
   might be sufficient for now, but since this will be a painful\
   transition process no matter the size, we believe jumping to 128 bits\
   is the appropriate choice.\
\
   Note: The current limit of ~1 million code points is a formal limit\
   due to what UTF-16 can encode today.  Increasing the limit will\
   either require deprecating UTF-16 or paying a hefty overhead penalty\
   to encode 128 bits across many pairs of surrogate code points.  Since\
   the ultimate goal of this document is to reduce global warming, the\
   challenge of choosing between deprecating UTF-16 or paying the\
   overhead price is a trivial dilemma to solve by comparison.\

RFC 8369                 Unicode IPv6 Addressing            1 April 2018\
\
\
3.  Unicode IPv6 Addresses\
\
   Assuming the new Unicode code point space is 128 bits -- excluding\
   some reserved bits for backwards compatibility and future expansion\
   -- it seems only natural to use Unicode code points for IPv6\
   addresses, and vice versa.  This leads to some exciting changes, such\
   as:\
\
   o  IPv6 addresses no longer need to be typed as hex values --\
      instead, the glyph for the script character, symbol, emoji, or\
      imoji representing that address can be input by the user, and it\
      will be displayed by the application as the graphic itself.  From\
      the user's perspective, this will also be more compact than the\
      representation described in RFC 1924 [RFC1924].\
\
   o  Network monitoring and troubleshooting tools can now display\
      pretty glyphs in place of ugly IPv6 addresses, leading to less\
      stress on the eyes of network administrators.\
\
   o  For cases where graphical glyphs cannot be used, such as IETF\
      documents, we can deprecate the legacy textual notation of IPv6\
      addresses of the style '2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334' to the\
      simpler Unicode textual notation\
      'U+20010DB885A3000000008A2E03707334'.  Using the short-name tag is\
      also possible, such as ':v6address-1:'.\
\
   Due to the nature of having IPv6 addresses be Unicode code points,\
   RFC 8135 [RFC8135] is made obsolete by this document.  It was found\
   to be too complex to implement anyway.\
\
3.1.  Reserved Addresses\
\
   Some address code points will be inappropriate for IPv6 addressing,\
   such as formatting characters and control codes.  Such code points\
   MUST NOT be used for IPv6 addresses.\
\
   We do, however, still need to reserve some code points for private\
   network use.  Since no sentient life has been found on Mars, the code\
   points that would have been allocated for Martian imojis are hereby\
   allocated for this private use.  These addresses are thus called\
   "Martians", also known as "Bogons" due to them being bogus.\
\
   Note: Should life be found on Mars in the future, new code points\
   will be allocated for them.  To avoid confusion, they will be called\
   "Barsoom Indigenous Glyph Off-world Network" addresses, or "Bigons"\
   (pronounced "bye-gons").  We're certain the Martians will let Bogons\
   be bygones, and Bigons be Bigons.\

RFC 8369                 Unicode IPv6 Addressing            1 April 2018\
\
\
3.2.  Multicast\
\
   In both IPv4 and IPv6, multicast addresses have been relegated to\
   predefined IP address ranges, limiting how many multicast groups\
   could be used simultaneously.  Given the rise of broadcasting-style\
   social media platforms, and the market demand for individuals to be\
   watched/followed by numerous random strangers constantly, it seems\
   clear that we need to be able to multicast everything, all the time.\
\
   To address this need, the high-order bit of the 128-bit code point\
   space SHALL be reserved to indicate multicast.  All valid code points\
   (i.e., IPv6 addresses) will thus have multicast counterparts.  For\
   example, the code point allocated for :cat: is U+1F408.  The\
   multicast group U+8000000000000000000000000001F408 is thus for\
   content about cats.  Note that this is for general cat content --\
   other code points are allocated for specific cat content, such as joy\
   cat, grinning cat, pouty cat, etc.  For an individual cat like\
   Garfield, setting the high-order bit to the code point allocated for\
   :garfield: will indicate that it is multicast content about Garfield.\
\
   Source-specific multicast also plays a role; for example, joining the\
   :garfield: multicast group and restricting it to a source of\
   :garfield: results in only receiving content about Garfield, from\
   Garfield.\
\
3.3.  IPv6 Routing\
\
   There should be little impact on routing using code-point-based IPv6\
   addresses.  There might be some exponential growth in routing and\
   forwarding tables due to difficulties in aggregating code points;\
   hopefully, this will be offset by increases in processor and memory\
   capacity.  Of course this will also drive the need to frequently\
   upgrade networking hardware, resulting in a boost to the global\
   economy, and thus a reduction in global warming.\
\
   One improvement to routing that MAY be considered is for scenic\
   routing as defined by RFC 7511 [RFC7511].  With emojis and imojis\
   being available for addressing, we can now specify which exact type\
   of scenery to visit along the way, or even which exact avian carrier\
   [RFC6214] to ride with.  Note that avian carriers as described in RFC\
   1149 [RFC1149] are not supported, since they only support IPv4.\

RFC 8369                 Unicode IPv6 Addressing            1 April 2018\
\
\
4.  Using Unicode IPv6 Addresses\
\
4.1.  Uniform Resource Identifiers\
\
   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and Uniform Resource Locators\
   (URLs) already support Unicode through Internationalized Resource\
   Identifiers (IRIs), but these are merely a means to use multiple\
   Unicode characters to indicate a resource.  With 128-bit Unicode, the\
   number space is large enough to identify each resource with a single\
   Unicode character.  Why waste space and time typing out multiple\
   characters, when you can just use one?\
\
   For URLs, this new model might only mean using a single Unicode\
   character for the hostname portion -- for example, a corporate logo\
   in place of the legacy corporate domain name.  Another alternative is\
   to allocate a code point for the entire host and path, possibly even\
   including the scheme.  These types of decisions can be made in future\
   IETF Working Groups.\
\
   The interesting aspect of this change for URIs/URLs is that no\
   address lookup needs to be performed.  The single 128-bit Unicode for\
   the URL *is* the IPv6 address.  An additional step is only needed if\
   the user inputs a private Unicode character or short-name tag that\
   needs to be converted to a publicly allocated one.  This would\
   require Network Address Translation (NAT) from the private code point\
   or short-name tag to a public Unicode code point.  This can be done\
   locally, thus finally bringing NATs into the last part of the\
   Internet in which they are not currently deployed: the user's\
   application.\
\
4.2.  Address Allocation and Resolution\
\
   It is obvious that once a single 128-bit Unicode character is used\
   for addresses and URIs, using domain names will quickly become\
   obsolete.  The subsequent collapse of the domain name industry\
   presents a threat to the world economy, which MUST be addressed.\
\
   One solution to this danger is to establish a Unicode registry model\
   and an accompanying Code Point Unicode Resolution System (CPURS,\
   pronounced "keepers").  CPURS would replace DNS and provide an\
   architecture and resolution mechanism to resolve Unicode code points\
   to their registered glyphs and short-name tags, and vice versa.  The\
   new Unicode registries and registrars would thus replace the legacy\
   domain name counterparts.  This would lead to a new gold rush for\
   registering Unicode code points for corporate logos and product\
   icons, and thus usher in an era of economic prosperity, which would\
   eventually reduce global warming.\
\

\
RFC 8369                 Unicode IPv6 Addressing            1 April 2018\
\
\
   Once Unicode registries and CPURS are in place, IPv6 addresses would\
   be allocated by registering code points through that system; they\
   would no longer be registered by IANA and RIRs.  This is not a major\
   concern, however, because any tax revenue loss will be more than\
   offset by Unicode registries allocating code points.  Furthermore, in\
   order to make CPURS possible, the actual graphic files for the glyphs\
   need to be standardized and created in numerous formats and sizes,\
   with various intellectual property rules.  This will provide more\
   work for graphic artists and lawyers, further increasing tax revenue.\
\
   The astute reader might ask why we need CPURS if Unicode translation\
   is performed locally on hosts today.  The answer is volume: it is\
   unlikely that host applications can keep up with the rate of new\
   Unicode code points being allocated for emojis, imojis, and umojis.\
   While application and operating system updates have been occurring at\
   an ever-increasing rate, and will soon reach the same rate as human\
   births, it is doubtful that it will ever reach the rate of sentient\
   extraterrestrial births.  Therefore, we need a system that can scale\
   to reach such volume before we make first contact; otherwise, the\
   diplomatic failure to quickly provide the aliens with amojis of their\
   own may lead to armed conflict.  An armed conflict with other\
   sentient beings capable of reaching Earth might increase global\
   warming, defeating this document's ultimate purpose.\
\
5.  Summary\
\
   There is still much to be decided on, most of which is frankly rather\
   boring.  It is clear, however, that 128-bit Unicode code points will\
   be needed eventually, and IPv6 addressing MUST be migrated to it.\
   Thus, the time to act is now!\
\
6.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document has no IANA actions.\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   The main security concern with using 128-bit Unicode for IPv6\
   addressing is the need for privacy, in terms of anonymity.  If an\
   IPv6 packet is sent with an imoji or amoji address, then man-in-the-\
   middle devices in the network will know the specific human or alien\
   that sent or received the packet.  Using such information might lead\
   to heated discussions, thereby increasing global warming.\
\
   To address this concern, an IPv6 address MAY be obfuscated by using\
   an omoji.  An omoji is simply the original Unicode code point but\
   with the least-significant bit set; all other types of 128-bit\
   Unicode code points MUST have the least-significant bit cleared.  The\

\
RFC 8369                 Unicode IPv6 Addressing            1 April 2018\
\
\
   graphical representation of an omoji is the same as its unobfsucated\
   moji counterpart, except that it is covered over by a solid black\
   block.\
\
   By setting the least-significant bit of the source or destination and\
   thus turning it into an omoji, the IPv6 address is obfuscated and the\
   true identity cannot be determined, while IPv6 routers can still\
   route the packet appropriately.  Note that this only provides a bit\
   of privacy, but every bit helps.\

      Techniques to Improve the Scalability of RSVP-TE Deployments\
\
Abstract\
\
   Networks that utilize RSVP-TE LSPs are encountering implementations\
   that have a limited ability to support the growth in the number of\
   LSPs deployed.\
\
   This document defines two techniques, Refresh-Interval Independent\
   RSVP (RI-RSVP) and Per-Peer Flow Control, that reduce the number of\
   processing cycles required to maintain RSVP-TE LSP state in Label\
   Switching Routers (LSRs) and hence allow implementations to support\
   larger scale deployments.\

RFC 8370              RSVP-TE Scaling - Techniques              May 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Networks that utilize RSVP-TE [RFC3209] LSPs are encountering\
   implementations that have a limited ability to support the growth in\
   the number of LSPs deployed.\
\
   The set of RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction procedures [RFC2961]\
   serves as a powerful toolkit for RSVP-TE implementations to help\
   cover a majority of the concerns about soft-state scaling.  However,\
   even with these tools in the toolkit, analysis of existing\
   implementations [RFC5439] indicates that the processing required\
   beyond a certain scale may still cause significant disruption to a\
   Label Switching Router (LSR).\
\
   This document builds on existing scaling work and analysis and\
   defines protocol extensions to help RSVP-TE deployments push the\
   envelope further on scaling by increasing the threshold above which\
   an LSR struggles to achieve sufficient processing to maintain LSP\
   state.\
\
   This document defines two techniques, Refresh-Interval Independent\
   RSVP (RI-RSVP) and Per-Peer Flow Control, that cut down the number of\
   processing cycles required to maintain LSP state.  RI-RSVP helps\
   completely eliminate RSVP's reliance on refreshes and refresh\
   timeouts, while Per-Peer Flow Control enables a busy RSVP speaker to\
   apply back pressure to its peer(s).  This document defines a unique\
   RSVP Capability [RFC5063] for each technique (support for the\
   CAPABILITY object is a prerequisite for implementing these\
   techniques).  Note that the Per-Peer Flow-Control technique requires\
   the RI-RSVP technique as a prerequisite.  In order to reap maximum\
   scaling benefits, it is strongly recommended that implementations\
   support both techniques and have them enabled by default.  Both\
   techniques are fully backward compatible and can be deployed\
   incrementally.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\

RFC 8370              RSVP-TE Scaling - Techniques              May 2018\
\
\
2.  Required Support for RFC 2961\
\
   The techniques defined in Sections 3 and 4 are based on proposals\
   made in [RFC2961].  Implementations of these techniques need to\
   support the RSVP messages and procedures defined in [RFC2961] with\
   some minor modifications and alterations to recommended time\
   intervals and iteration counts (see Appendix A for the set of\
   recommended defaults).\
\
2.1.  Required Functionality from RFC 2961\
\
   An implementation that supports the techniques discussed in Sections\
   3 and 4 must support the functionality described in [RFC2961] as\
   follows:\
\
   o  It MUST indicate support for RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction\
      extensions (as specified in Section 2 of [RFC2961]).\
\
   o  It MUST support receipt of any RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction\
      message as defined in [RFC2961].\
\
   o  It MUST initiate all RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction mechanisms as\
      defined in [RFC2961] (including the SRefresh message) with the\
      default behavior being to initiate the mechanisms; however, a\
      configuration override should be offered.\
\
   o  It MUST support reliable delivery of Path/Resv and the\
      corresponding Tear/Err messages (as specified in Section 4 of\
      [RFC2961]).\
\
   o  It MUST support retransmission of all unacknowledged RSVP-TE\
      messages using exponential backoff (as specified in Section 6 of\
      [RFC2961]).\
\
2.2.  Making Acknowledgements Mandatory\
\
   The reliable message delivery mechanism specified in [RFC2961] states\
   that "Nodes receiving a non-out of order [sic] message containing a\
   MESSAGE_ID object with the ACK_Desired flag set, SHOULD respond with\
   a MESSAGE_ID_ACK object."\
\
   In an implementation that supports the techniques discussed in\
   Sections 3 and 4, nodes receiving a non-out-of-order message\
   containing a MESSAGE_ID object with the ACK_Desired flag set MUST\
   respond with a MESSAGE_ID_ACK object.  This MESSAGE_ID_ACK object can\
   be packed with other MESSAGE_ID_ACK or MESSAGE_ID_NACK objects and\
   sent in an Ack message (or piggybacked in any other RSVP message).\

RFC 8370              RSVP-TE Scaling - Techniques              May 2018\
\
\
   This improvement to the predictability of the system in terms of\
   reliable message delivery is key for being able to take any action\
   based on a non-receipt of an ACK.\
\
3.  Refresh-Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP)\
\
   The RSVP protocol relies on periodic refreshes for state\
   synchronization between RSVP neighbors and recovery from lost RSVP\
   messages.  It relies on a refresh timeout for stale-state cleanup.\
   The primary motivation behind introducing the notion of Refresh-\
   Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP) is to completely eliminate RSVP's\
   reliance on refreshes and refresh timeouts.  This is done by simply\
   increasing the refresh interval to a fairly large value.  [RFC2961]\
   and [RFC5439] talk about increasing the value of the refresh interval\
   to provide linear improvement of transmission overhead, but they also\
   point out the degree of functionality that is lost by doing so.  This\
   section revisits this notion, but also sets out additional\
   requirements to make sure that there is no loss of functionality\
   incurred by increasing the value of the refresh interval.\
\
   An implementation that supports RI-RSVP:\
\
   o  MUST support all of the requirements specified in Section 2.\
\
   o  MUST make the default value of the configurable refresh interval\
      (R) be a large value (tens of minutes).  A default value of 20\
      minutes is RECOMMENDED by this document.\
\
   o  MUST use a separate shorter refresh interval for refreshing state\
      associated with unacknowledged Path/Resv (uR) messages.  A default\
      value of 30 seconds is RECOMMENDED by this document.\
\
   o  MUST implement coupling the state of individual LSPs with the\
      state of the corresponding RSVP-TE signaling adjacency.  When an\
      RSVP-TE speaker detects RSVP-TE signaling adjacency failure, the\
      speaker MUST act as if all the Path and Resv states learned via\
      the failed signaling adjacency have timed out.\
\
   o  MUST make use of the Hello session based on the Node-ID ([RFC3209]\
      [RFC4558]) for detection of RSVP-TE signaling adjacency failures.\
      A default value of 9 seconds is RECOMMENDED by this document for\
      the configurable node hello interval (as opposed to the default\
      value of 5 milliseconds proposed in Section 5.3 of [RFC3209]).\
\
   o  MUST indicate support for RI-RSVP via the CAPABILITY object\
      [RFC5063] in Hello messages.\

RFC 8370              RSVP-TE Scaling - Techniques              May 2018\
\
\
3.1.  Capability Advertisement\
\
   An implementation supporting the RI-RSVP technique MUST set a new\
   flag, RI-RSVP Capable, in the CAPABILITY object signaled in Hello\
   messages.  The following bit indicates that the sender supports\
   RI-RSVP:\
\
      Bit Number 28 (0x0008) - RI-RSVP Capable (I-bit)\
\
   Any node that sets the new I-bit in its CAPABILITY object MUST also\
   set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit [RFC2961] in the common header\
   of all RSVP-TE messages.  If a peer sets the I-bit in the CAPABILITY\
   object but does not set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit, then the\
   RI-RSVP functionality MUST NOT be activated for that peer.\
\
3.2.  Compatibility\
\
   The RI-RSVP functionality MUST NOT be activated with a peer that does\
   not indicate support for this functionality.  Inactivation of the\
   RI-RSVP functionality MUST result in the use of the traditional\
   smaller refresh interval [RFC2205].\
\
4.  Per-Peer Flow Control\
\
   The functionality discussed in this section provides an RSVP speaker\
   with the ability to apply back pressure to its peer(s) to reduce/\
   eliminate a significant portion of the RSVP-TE control message load.\
\
   An implementation that supports Per-Peer Flow Control:\
\
   o  MUST support all of the requirements specified in Section 2.\
\
   o  MUST support RI-RSVP (Section 3).\
\
   o  MUST treat lack of ACKs from a peer as an indication of a peer's\
      RSVP-TE control-plane congestion.  If congestion is detected, the\
      local system MUST throttle RSVP-TE messages to the affected peer.\
      This MUST be done on a per-peer basis.  (Per-peer throttling MAY\
      be implemented by a traffic-shaping mechanism that proportionally\
      reduces the RSVP-signaling packet rate as the number of\
      outstanding ACKs increases.  When the number of outstanding ACKs\
      decreases, the send rate would be adjusted up again.)\
\
   o  SHOULD use a Retry Limit (Rl) value of 7 (Section 6.2 of [RFC2961]\
      suggests using 3).\
\
   o  SHOULD prioritize Hello messages and messages carrying\
      Acknowledgements over other RSVP messages.\

RFC 8370              RSVP-TE Scaling - Techniques              May 2018\
\
\
   o  SHOULD prioritize Tear/Error over trigger Path/Resv (messages that\
      bring up new LSP state) sent to a peer when the local system\
      detects RSVP-TE control-plane congestion in the peer.\
\
   o  MUST indicate support for this technique via the CAPABILITY object\
      [RFC5063] in Hello messages.\
\
4.1.  Capability Advertisement\
\
   An implementation supporting the Per-Peer Flow-Control technique MUST\
   set a new flag, Per-Peer Flow-Control Capable, in the CAPABILITY\
   object signaled in Hello messages.  The following bit indicates that\
   the sender supports Per-Peer Flow Control:\
\
      Bit Number 27 (0x0010) - Per-Peer Flow-Control Capable (F-bit)\
\
   Any node that sets the new F-bit in its CAPABILITY object MUST also\
   set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit in the common header of all\
   RSVP-TE messages.  If a peer sets the F-bit in the CAPABILITY object\
   but does not set the Refresh-Reduction-Capable bit, then the Per-Peer\
   Flow-Control functionality MUST NOT be activated for that peer.\
\
4.2.  Compatibility\
\
   The Per-Peer Flow-Control functionality MUST NOT be activated with a\
   peer that does not indicate support for this functionality.  If a\
   peer hasn't indicated that it is capable of participating in Per-Peer\
   Flow Control, then it SHOULD NOT be assumed that the peer would\
   always acknowledge a non-out-of-order message containing a MESSAGE_ID\
   object with the ACK_Desired flag set.\
\
5.  IANA Considerations\
\
5.1.  Capability Object Values\
\
   IANA maintains the "Capability Object values" subregistry [RFC5063]\
   within the "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry\
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters>.  IANA has assigned\
   two new Capability Object Value bit flags as follows:\
\
      Bit      Hex     Name                                Reference\
      Number   Value\
      ------------------------------------------------------------------\
        28     0x0008  RI-RSVP Capable (I)                 Section 3\
        27     0x0010  Per-Peer Flow-Control Capable (F)   Section 4\

6.  Security Considerations\
\
   This document does not introduce new security issues.  The security\
   considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol [RFC2205] and\
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209], and those that are described in [RFC5920], remain\

\
\
Appendix A.  Recommended Defaults\
\
   a.  Refresh Interval (R) - 20 minutes (Section 3):\
       Given that an implementation supporting RI-RSVP doesn't rely on\
       refreshes for state sync between peers, the function of the RSVP\
       refresh interval is analogous to that of IGP refresh interval\
       (the default of which is typically in the order of tens of\
       minutes).  Choosing a default of 20 minutes allows the refresh\
       timer to be randomly set to a value in the range [10 minutes\
       (0.5R), 30 minutes (1.5R)].\
\
   b.  Node Hello Interval - 9 seconds (Section 3):\
\
       [RFC3209] defines the hello timeout as 3.5 times the hello\
       interval.  Choosing 9 seconds for the node hello interval gives a\
       hello timeout of 3.5 * 9 = 31.5 seconds.  This puts the hello\
       timeout value in the vicinity of the IGP hello timeout value.\
\
   c.  Retry-Limit (Rl) - 7 (Section 4):\
       Choosing 7 as the retry-limit results in an overall rapid\
       retransmit phase of 31.5 seconds.  This matches up with the hello\
       timeout of 31.5 seconds.\
\
   d.  Refresh Interval for refreshing state associated with\
       unacknowledged Path/Resv messages (uR) - 30 seconds (Section 3):\
       The recommended refresh interval (R) value of 20 minutes (for an\
       implementation supporting RI-RSVP) cannot be used for refreshing\
       state associated with unacknowledged Path/Resv messages.  This\
       document recommends the use of the traditional default refresh\
       interval value of 30 seconds for uR.\

   This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher as well as the use\
   of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms and as\
   a "combined mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data\
   (AEAD) algorithm.\

\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES -- [FIPS-197]) has become the\
   gold standard in encryption.  Its efficient design, widespread\
   implementation, and hardware support allow for high performance in\
   many areas.  On most modern platforms, AES is anywhere from four to\
   ten times as fast as the previous most-used cipher, Triple Data\
   Encryption Standard (3DES -- [SP800-67]), which makes it not only the\
   best choice, but the only practical choice.\
\
   There are several problems with this.  If future advances in\
   cryptanalysis reveal a weakness in AES, users will be in an\
   unenviable position.  With the only other widely supported cipher\
   being the much slower 3DES, it is not feasible to reconfigure\
   deployments to use 3DES.  [Standby-Cipher] describes this issue and\
   the need for a standby cipher in greater detail.  Another problem is\
   that while AES is very fast on dedicated hardware, its performance on\
   platforms that lack such hardware is considerably lower.  Yet another\
   problem is that many AES implementations are vulnerable to cache-\
   collision timing attacks ([Cache-Collisions]).\
\
   This document provides a definition and implementation guide for\
   three algorithms:\
\
   1.  The ChaCha20 cipher.  This is a high-speed cipher first described\
       in [ChaCha].  It is considerably faster than AES in software-only\
       implementations, making it around three times as fast on\
       platforms that lack specialized AES hardware.  See Appendix B for\
       some hard numbers.  ChaCha20 is also not sensitive to timing\
       attacks (see the security considerations in Section 4).  This\
       algorithm is described in Section 2.4\
\
   2.  The Poly1305 authenticator.  This is a high-speed message\
       authentication code.  Implementation is also straightforward and\
       easy to get right.  The algorithm is described in Section 2.5.\
\
   3.  The CHACHA20-POLY1305 Authenticated Encryption with Associated\
       Data (AEAD) construction, described in Section 2.8.\
\
   This document and its predecessor do not introduce these new\
   algorithms for the first time.  They have been defined in scientific\
   papers by D. J. Bernstein [ChaCha][Poly1305].  The purpose of this\
   document is to serve as a stable reference for IETF documents making\
   use of these algorithms.\
\
   These algorithms have undergone rigorous analysis.  Several papers\
   discuss the security of Salsa and ChaCha ([LatinDances],\
   [LatinDances2], [Zhenqing2012]).\

RFC 8439                   ChaCha20 & Poly1305                 June 2018\
\
\
   This document represents the consensus of the Crypto Forum Research\
   Group (CFRG).  It replaces [RFC7539].\
\
1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
   The description of the ChaCha algorithm will at various time refer to\
   the ChaCha state as a "vector" or as a "matrix".  This follows the\
   use of these terms in [ChaCha].  The matrix notation is more visually\
   convenient and gives a better notion as to why some rounds are called\
   "column rounds" while others are called "diagonal rounds".  Here's a\
   diagram of how the matrices relate to vectors (using the C language\
   convention of zero being the index origin).\
\
      0   1   2   3\
      4   5   6   7\
      8   9  10  11\
     12  13  14  15\
\
   The elements in this vector or matrix are 32-bit unsigned integers.\
\
   The algorithm name is "ChaCha".  "ChaCha20" is a specific instance\
   where 20 "rounds" (or 80 quarter rounds -- see Section 2.1) are used.\
   Other variations are defined, with 8 or 12 rounds, but in this\
   document we only describe the 20-round ChaCha, so the names "ChaCha"\
   and "ChaCha20" will be used interchangeably.\
\
2.  The Algorithms\
\
   The subsections below describe the algorithms used and the AEAD\
   construction.\
\
2.1.  The ChaCha Quarter Round\
\
   The basic operation of the ChaCha algorithm is the quarter round.  It\
   operates on four 32-bit unsigned integers, denoted a, b, c, and d.\
   The operation is as follows (in C-like notation):\
\
      a += b; d ^= a; d <<<= 16;\
      c += d; b ^= c; b <<<= 12;\
      a += b; d ^= a; d <<<= 8;\
      c += d; b ^= c; b <<<= 7;\

RFC 8439                   ChaCha20 & Poly1305                 June 2018\
\
\
   Where "+" denotes integer addition modulo 2^32, "^" denotes a bitwise\
   Exclusive OR (XOR), and "<<< n" denotes an n-bit left roll (towards\
   the high bits).\
\
   For example, let's see the add, XOR, and roll operations from the\
   fourth line with sample numbers:\
\
      a = 0x11111111\
      b = 0x01020304\
      c = 0x77777777\
      d = 0x01234567\
      c = c + d = 0x77777777 + 0x01234567 = 0x789abcde\
      b = b ^ c = 0x01020304 ^ 0x789abcde = 0x7998bfda\
      b = b <<< 7 = 0x7998bfda <<< 7 = 0xcc5fed3c\
\
2.1.1.  Test Vector for the ChaCha Quarter Round\
\
   For a test vector, we will use the same numbers as in the example,\
   adding something random for c.\
\
      a = 0x11111111\
      b = 0x01020304\
      c = 0x9b8d6f43\
      d = 0x01234567\
\
   After running a Quarter Round on these four numbers, we get these:\
\
      a = 0xea2a92f4\
      b = 0xcb1cf8ce\
      c = 0x4581472e\
      d = 0x5881c4bb\
\
2.2.  A Quarter Round on the ChaCha State\
\
   The ChaCha state does not have four integer numbers: it has 16.  So\
   the quarter-round operation works on only four of them -- hence the\
   name.  Each quarter round operates on four predetermined numbers in\
   the ChaCha state.  We will denote by QUARTERROUND(x, y, z, w) a\
   quarter-round operation on the numbers at indices x, y, z, and w of\
   the ChaCha state when viewed as a vector.  For example, if we apply\
   QUARTERROUND(1, 5, 9, 13) to a state, this means running the quarter-\
   round operation on the elements marked with an asterisk, while\
   leaving the others alone:\
\
      0  *a   2   3\
      4  *b   6   7\
      8  *c  10  11\
     12  *d  14  15\

\
\
   Note that this run of quarter round is part of what is called a\
   "column round".\
\
2.2.1.  Test Vector for the Quarter Round on the ChaCha State\
\
   For a test vector, we will use a ChaCha state that was generated\
   randomly:\
\
   Sample ChaCha State\
\
       879531e0  c5ecf37d  516461b1  c9a62f8a\
       44c20ef3  3390af7f  d9fc690b  2a5f714c\
       53372767  b00a5631  974c541a  359e9963\
       5c971061  3d631689  2098d9d6  91dbd320\
\
   We will apply the QUARTERROUND(2, 7, 8, 13) operation to this state.\
   For obvious reasons, this one is part of what is called a "diagonal\
   round":\
\
   After applying QUARTERROUND(2, 7, 8, 13)\
\
       879531e0  c5ecf37d *bdb886dc  c9a62f8a\
       44c20ef3  3390af7f  d9fc690b *cfacafd2\
      *e46bea80  b00a5631  974c541a  359e9963\
       5c971061 *ccc07c79  2098d9d6  91dbd320\
\
   Note that only the numbers in positions 2, 7, 8, and 13 changed.\
\
2.3.  The ChaCha20 Block Function\
\
   The ChaCha block function transforms a ChaCha state by running\
   multiple quarter rounds.\
\
   The inputs to ChaCha20 are:\
\
   o  A 256-bit key, treated as a concatenation of eight 32-bit little-\
      endian integers.\
\
   o  A 96-bit nonce, treated as a concatenation of three 32-bit little-\
      endian integers.\
\
   o  A 32-bit block count parameter, treated as a 32-bit little-endian\
      integer.\
\
   The output is 64 random-looking bytes.\
\

RFC 8439                   ChaCha20 & Poly1305                 June 2018\
\
\
   The ChaCha algorithm described here uses a 256-bit key.  The original\
   algorithm also specified 128-bit keys and 8- and 12-round variants,\
   but these are out of scope for this document.  In this section, we\
   describe the ChaCha block function.\
\
   Note also that the original ChaCha had a 64-bit nonce and 64-bit\
   block count.  We have modified this here to be more consistent with\
   recommendations in Section 3.2 of [RFC5116].  This limits the use of\
   a single (key,nonce) combination to 2^32 blocks, or 256 GB, but that\
   is enough for most uses.  In cases where a single key is used by\
   multiple senders, it is important to make sure that they don't use\
   the same nonces.  This can be assured by partitioning the nonce space\
   so that the first 32 bits are unique per sender, while the other 64\
   bits come from a counter.\
\
   The ChaCha20 state is initialized as follows:\
\
   o  The first four words (0-3) are constants: 0x61707865, 0x3320646e,\
      0x79622d32, 0x6b206574.\
\
   o  The next eight words (4-11) are taken from the 256-bit key by\
      reading the bytes in little-endian order, in 4-byte chunks.\
\
   o  Word 12 is a block counter.  Since each block is 64-byte, a 32-bit\
      word is enough for 256 gigabytes of data.\
\
   o  Words 13-15 are a nonce, which MUST not be repeated for the same\
      key.  The 13th word is the first 32 bits of the input nonce taken\
      as a little-endian integer, while the 15th word is the last 32\
      bits.\

RFC 8439                   ChaCha20 & Poly1305                 June 2018\
\
\
   ChaCha20 runs 20 rounds, alternating between "column rounds" and\
   "diagonal rounds".  Each round consists of four quarter-rounds, and\
   they are run as follows.  Quarter rounds 1-4 are part of a "column"\
   round, while 5-8 are part of a "diagonal" round:\
\
      QUARTERROUND(0, 4, 8, 12)\
      QUARTERROUND(1, 5, 9, 13)\
      QUARTERROUND(2, 6, 10, 14)\
      QUARTERROUND(3, 7, 11, 15)\
      QUARTERROUND(0, 5, 10, 15)\
      QUARTERROUND(1, 6, 11, 12)\
      QUARTERROUND(2, 7, 8, 13)\
      QUARTERROUND(3, 4, 9, 14)\
\
   At the end of 20 rounds (or 10 iterations of the above list), we add\
   the original input words to the output words, and serialize the\
   result by sequencing the words one-by-one in little-endian order.\
\
   Note: "addition" in the above paragraph is done modulo 2^32.  In some\
   machine languages, this is called carryless addition on a 32-bit\
   word.\
\
2.3.1.  The ChaCha20 Block Function in Pseudocode\
\
   Note: This section and a few others contain pseudocode for the\
   algorithm explained in a previous section.  Every effort was made for\
   the pseudocode to accurately reflect the algorithm as described in\
   the preceding section.  If a conflict is still present, the textual\
   explanation and the test vectors are normative.\
\

         Qround(state, 0, 4, 8, 12)\

\
2.3.2.  Test Vector for the ChaCha20 Block Function\
\
   For a test vector, we will use the following inputs to the ChaCha20\
   block function:\
\
   o  Key = 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f:10:11:12:13:\
      14:15:16:17:18:19:1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f.  The key is a sequence of\
      octets with no particular structure before we copy it into the\
      ChaCha state.\
\
   o  Nonce = (00:00:00:09:00:00:00:4a:00:00:00:00)\
\
   o  Block Count = 1.\
\
   After setting up the ChaCha state, it looks like this:\

\
   After running 20 rounds (10 column rounds interleaved with 10\
   "diagonal rounds"), the ChaCha state looks like this:\

\
2.4.  The ChaCha20 Encryption Algorithm\
\
   ChaCha20 is a stream cipher designed by D. J. Bernstein.  It is a\
   refinement of the Salsa20 algorithm, and it uses a 256-bit key.\
\
   ChaCha20 successively calls the ChaCha20 block function, with the\
   same key and nonce, and with successively increasing block counter\
   parameters.  ChaCha20 then serializes the resulting state by writing\
   the numbers in little-endian order, creating a keystream block.\
   Concatenating the keystream blocks from the successive blocks forms a\
   keystream.  The ChaCha20 function then performs an XOR of this\
   keystream with the plaintext.  Alternatively, each keystream block\
   can be XORed with a plaintext block before proceeding to create the\
   next block, saving some memory.  There is no requirement for the\
   plaintext to be an integral multiple of 512 bits.  If there is extra\
   keystream from the last block, it is discarded.  Specific protocols\
   MAY require that the plaintext and ciphertext have certain length.\
   Such protocols need to specify how the plaintext is padded and how\
   much padding it receives.\
\
   The inputs to ChaCha20 are:\
\
   o  A 256-bit key\
\
   o  A 32-bit initial counter.  This can be set to any number, but will\
      usually be zero or one.  It makes sense to use one if we use the\
      zero block for something else, such as generating a one-time\
      authenticator key as part of an AEAD algorithm.\
\
   o  A 96-bit nonce.  In some protocols, this is known as the\
      Initialization Vector.\
\
   o  An arbitrary-length plaintext\

\
\
   The output is an encrypted message, or "ciphertext", of the same\
   length.\
\
   Decryption is done in the same way.  The ChaCha20 block function is\
   used to expand the key into a keystream, which is XORed with the\
   ciphertext giving back the plaintext.\
\
2.4.1.  The ChaCha20 Encryption Algorithm in Pseudocode\
\
     chacha20_encrypt(key, counter, nonce, plaintext):\
        for j = 0 upto floor(len(plaintext)/64)-1\
           key_stream = chacha20_block(key, counter+j, nonce)\
           block = plaintext[(j*64)..(j*64+63)]\
           encrypted_message +=  block ^ key_stream\
           end\
        if ((len(plaintext) % 64) != 0)\
           j = floor(len(plaintext)/64)\
           key_stream = chacha20_block(key, counter+j, nonce)\
           block = plaintext[(j*64)..len(plaintext)-1]\
           encrypted_message += (block^key_stream)[0..len(plaintext)%64]\
           end\
        return encrypted_message\
        end\
\
2.4.2.  Example and Test Vector for the ChaCha20 Cipher\
\
   For a test vector, we will use the following inputs to the ChaCha20\
   block function:\
\
   o  Key = 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f:10:11:12:13:\
      14:15:16:17:18:19:1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f.\
\
   o  Nonce = (00:00:00:00:00:00:00:4a:00:00:00:00).\
\
   o  Initial Counter = 1.\
\
   We use the following for the plaintext.  It was chosen to be long\
   enough to require more than one block, but not so long that it would\
   make this example cumbersome (so, less than 3 blocks):\

\
2.5.  The Poly1305 Algorithm\
\
   Poly1305 is a one-time authenticator designed by D. J. Bernstein.\
   Poly1305 takes a 32-byte one-time key and a message and produces a\
   16-byte tag.  This tag is used to authenticate the message.\
\
   The original article ([Poly1305]) is titled "The Poly1305-AES\
   message-authentication code", and the MAC function there requires a\
   128-bit AES key, a 128-bit "additional key", and a 128-bit (non-\
   secret) nonce.  AES is used there for encrypting the nonce, so as to\
   get a unique (and secret) 128-bit string, but as the paper states,\
   "There is nothing special about AES here.  One can replace AES with\
   an arbitrary keyed function from an arbitrary set of nonces to\
   16-byte strings."\
\
   Regardless of how the key is generated, the key is partitioned into\
   two parts, called "r" and "s".  The pair (r,s) should be unique, and\
   MUST be unpredictable for each invocation (that is why it was\
   originally obtained by encrypting a nonce), while "r" MAY be\
   constant, but needs to be modified as follows before being used: ("r"\
   is treated as a 16-octet little-endian number):\
\
   o  r[3], r[7], r[11], and r[15] are required to have their top four\
      bits clear (be smaller than 16)\
\
   o  r[4], r[8], and r[12] are required to have their bottom two bits\
      clear (be divisible by 4)\

\
\
   The following sample code clamps "r" to be appropriate:\

   Adapted from poly1305aes_test_clamp.c version 20050207\
   D. J. Bernstein\

     r[15] &= 15;\
     r[4] &= 252;\
     r[8] &= 252;\
     r[12] &= 252;\
   }\
\
   Where "&=" is the C language bitwise AND assignment operator.\
\
   The "s" should be unpredictable, but it is perfectly acceptable to\
   generate both "r" and "s" uniquely each time.  Because each of them\
   is 128 bits, pseudorandomly generating them (see Section 2.6) is also\
   acceptable.\
\
   The inputs to Poly1305 are:\
\
   o  A 256-bit one-time key\
\
   o  An arbitrary length message\
\
   The output is a 128-bit tag.\
\
   First, the "r" value is clamped.\
\
   Next, set the constant prime "P" be 2^130-5:\
   3fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffb.  Also set a variable "accumulator"\
   to zero.\

\
\
   Next, divide the message into 16-byte blocks.  The last one might be\
   shorter:\
\
   o  Read the block as a little-endian number.\
\
   o  Add one bit beyond the number of octets.  For a 16-byte block,\
      this is equivalent to adding 2^128 to the number.  For the shorter\
\
      block, it can be 2^120, 2^112, or any power of two that is evenly\
      divisible by 8, all the way down to 2^8.\
\
   o  If the block is not 17 bytes long (the last block), pad it with\
      zeros.  This is meaningless if you are treating the blocks as\
      numbers.\
\
   o  Add this number to the accumulator.\
\
   o  Multiply by "r".\
\
   o  Set the accumulator to the result modulo p.  To summarize: Acc =\
      ((Acc+block)*r) % p.\
\
   Finally, the value of the secret key "s" is added to the accumulator,\
   and the 128 least significant bits are serialized in little-endian\
   order to form the tag.\

\
2.6.  Generating the Poly1305 Key Using ChaCha20\
\
   As said in Section 2.5, it is acceptable to generate the one-time\
   Poly1305 key pseudorandomly.  This section defines such a method.\
\
   To generate such a key pair (r,s), we will use the ChaCha20 block\
   function described in Section 2.3.  This assumes that we have a\
   256-bit session key specifically for the Message Authentication Code\
   (MAC) function.  Any document that specifies the use of Poly1305 as a\
   MAC algorithm for some protocol MUST specify that 256 bits are\
   allocated for the integrity key.  Note that in the AEAD construction\
   defined in Section 2.8, the same key is used for encryption and key\
   generation.\
\
   The method is to call the block function with the following\
   parameters:\
\
   o  The 256-bit session integrity key is used as the ChaCha20 key.\
\
   o  The block counter is set to zero.\
\
   o  The protocol will specify a 96-bit or 64-bit nonce.  This MUST be\
      unique per invocation with the same key, so it MUST NOT be\
      randomly generated.  A counter is a good way to implement this,\
      but other methods, such as a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)\
      are also acceptable.  ChaCha20 as specified here requires a 96-bit\
      nonce.  So if the provided nonce is only 64-bit, then the first 32\
      bits of the nonce will be set to a constant number.  This will\
      usually be zero, but for protocols with multiple senders it may be\
      different for each sender, but SHOULD be the same for all\
      invocations of the function with the same key by a particular\
      sender.\

RFC 8439                   ChaCha20 & Poly1305                 June 2018\
\
\
   After running the block function, we have a 512-bit state.  We take\
   the first 256 bits of the serialized state, and use those as the one-\
   time Poly1305 key: the first 128 bits are clamped and form "r", while\
   the next 128 bits become "s".  The other 256 bits are discarded.\
\
   Note that while many protocols have provisions for a nonce for\
   encryption algorithms (often called Initialization Vectors, or IVs),\
   they usually don't have such a provision for the MAC function.  In\
   that case, the per-invocation nonce will have to come from somewhere\
   else, such as a message counter.\

\
\
2.7.  A Pseudorandom Function for Crypto Suites Based on ChaCha/Poly1305\
\
   Some protocols, such as IKEv2 ([RFC7296]), require a Pseudorandom\
   Function (PRF), mostly for key derivation.  In the IKEv2 definition,\
   a PRF is a function that accepts a variable-length key and a\
   variable-length input, and returns a fixed-length output.  Most\
   commonly, Hashed MAC (HMAC) constructions are used for this purpose,\
   and often the same function is used for both message authentication\
   and PRF.\
\
   Poly1305 is not a suitable choice for a PRF.  Poly1305 prohibits\
   using the same key twice, whereas the PRF in IKEv2 is used multiple\
   times with the same key.  Additionally, unlike HMAC, Poly1305 is\
   biased, so using it for key derivation would reduce the security of\
   the symmetric encryption.\
\
   Chacha20 could be used as a key-derivation function, by generating an\
   arbitrarily long keystream.  However, that is not what protocols such\
   as IKEv2 require.\
\
   For this reason, this document does not specify a PRF.\
\
2.8.  AEAD Construction\
\
   AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 is an authenticated encryption with additional\
   data algorithm.  The inputs to AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 are:\
\
   o  A 256-bit key\
\
   o  A 96-bit nonce -- different for each invocation with the same key\
\
   o  An arbitrary length plaintext\
\
   o  Arbitrary length additional authenticated data (AAD)\
\
   Some protocols may have unique per-invocation inputs that are not 96\
   bits in length.  For example, IPsec may specify a 64-bit nonce.  In\
   such a case, it is up to the protocol document to define how to\
   transform the protocol nonce into a 96-bit nonce, for example, by\
   concatenating a constant value.\
\
   The ChaCha20 and Poly1305 primitives are combined into an AEAD that\
   takes a 256-bit key and 96-bit nonce as follows:\
\
   o  First, a Poly1305 one-time key is generated from the 256-bit key\
      and nonce using the procedure described in Section 2.6.\

RFC 8439                   ChaCha20 & Poly1305                 June 2018\
\
\
   o  Next, the ChaCha20 encryption function is called to encrypt the\
      plaintext, using the same key and nonce, and with the initial\
      counter set to 1.\
\
   o  Finally, the Poly1305 function is called with the Poly1305 key\
      calculated above, and a message constructed as a concatenation of\
      the following:\
\
      *  The AAD\
\
      *  padding1 -- the padding is up to 15 zero bytes, and it brings\
         the total length so far to an integral multiple of 16.  If the\
         length of the AAD was already an integral multiple of 16 bytes,\
         this field is zero-length.\
\
      *  The ciphertext\
\
      *  padding2 -- the padding is up to 15 zero bytes, and it brings\
         the total length so far to an integral multiple of 16.  If the\
         length of the ciphertext was already an integral multiple of 16\
         bytes, this field is zero-length.\
\
      *  The length of the additional data in octets (as a 64-bit\
         little-endian integer).\
\
      *  The length of the ciphertext in octets (as a 64-bit little-\
         endian integer).\
\
   The output from the AEAD is the concatenation of:\
\
   o  A ciphertext of the same length as the plaintext.\
\
   o  A 128-bit tag, which is the output of the Poly1305 function.\
\
   Decryption is similar with the following differences:\
\
   o  The roles of ciphertext and plaintext are reversed, so the\
      ChaCha20 encryption function is applied to the ciphertext,\
      producing the plaintext.\
\
   o  The Poly1305 function is still run on the AAD and the ciphertext,\
      not the plaintext.\
\
   o  The calculated tag is bitwise compared to the received tag.  The\
      message is authenticated if and only if the tags match.\

RFC 8439                   ChaCha20 & Poly1305                 June 2018\
\
\
   A few notes about this design:\
\
   1.  The amount of encrypted data possible in a single invocation is\
       2^32-1 blocks of 64 bytes each, because of the size of the block\
       counter field in the ChaCha20 block function.  This gives a total\
       of 274,877,906,880 bytes, or nearly 256 GB.  This should be\
       enough for traffic protocols such as IPsec and TLS, but may be\
       too small for file and/or disk encryption.  For such uses, we can\
       return to the original design, reduce the nonce to 64 bits, and\
       use the integer at position 13 as the top 32 bits of a 64-bit\
       block counter, increasing the total message size to over a\
       million petabytes (1,180,591,620,717,411,303,360 bytes to be\
       exact).\
\
   2.  Despite the previous item, the ciphertext length field in the\
       construction of the buffer on which Poly1305 runs limits the\
       ciphertext (and hence, the plaintext) size to 2^64 bytes, or\
       sixteen thousand petabytes (18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes to\
       be exact).\
\
   The AEAD construction in this section is a novel composition of\
   ChaCha20 and Poly1305.  A security analysis of this composition is\
   given in [Procter].\
\
   Here is a list of the parameters for this construction as defined in\
   Section 4 of [RFC5116]:\
\
   o  K_LEN (key length) is 32 octets.\
\
   o  P_MAX (maximum size of the plaintext) is 274,877,906,880 bytes, or\
      nearly 256 GB.\
\
   o  A_MAX (maximum size of the associated data) is set to 2^64-1\
      octets by the length field for associated data.\
\
   o  N_MIN = N_MAX = 12 octets.\
\
   o  C_MAX = P_MAX + tag length = 274,877,906,896 octets.\
\
   Distinct AAD inputs (as described in Section 3.3 of [RFC5116]) shall\
   be concatenated into a single input to AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305.  It is\
   up to the application to create a structure in the AAD input if it is\
   needed.\

3.  Implementation Advice\
\
   Each block of ChaCha20 involves 16 move operations and one increment\
   operation for loading the state, 80 each of XOR, addition and roll\
   operations for the rounds, 16 more add operations and 16 XOR\
   operations for protecting the plaintext.  Section 2.3 describes the\
   ChaCha block function as "adding the original input words".  This\
   implies that before starting the rounds on the ChaCha state, we copy\
   it aside, only to add it in later.  This is correct, but we can save\
   a few operations if we instead copy the state and do the work on the\
   copy.  This way, for the next block you don't need to recreate the\
   state, but only to increment the block counter.  This saves\
   approximately 5.5% of the cycles.\
\
   It is not recommended to use a generic big number library such as the\
   one in OpenSSL for the arithmetic operations in Poly1305.  Such\
   libraries use dynamic allocation to be able to handle an integer of\
   any size, but that flexibility comes at the expense of performance as\
   well as side-channel security.  More efficient implementations that\
   run in constant time are available, one of them in D. J. Bernstein's\
   own library, NaCl ([NaCl]).  A constant-time but not optimal approach\
   would be to naively implement the arithmetic operations for 288-bit\
   integers, because even a naive implementation will not exceed 2^288\
   in the multiplication of (acc+block) and r.  An efficient constant-\
   time implementation can be found in the public domain library\
   poly1305-donna ([Poly1305_Donna]).\

\
\
4.  Security Considerations\
\
   The ChaCha20 cipher is designed to provide 256-bit security.\
\
   The Poly1305 authenticator is designed to ensure that forged messages\
   are rejected with a probability of 1-(n/(2^102)) for a 16n-byte\
   message, even after sending 2^64 legitimate messages, so it is\
   SUF-CMA (strong unforgeability against chosen-message attacks) in the\
   terminology of [AE].\
\
   Proving the security of either of these is beyond the scope of this\
   document.  Such proofs are available in the referenced academic\
   papers ([ChaCha], [Poly1305], [LatinDances], [LatinDances2], and\
   [Zhenqing2012]).\
\
   The most important security consideration in implementing this\
   document is the uniqueness of the nonce used in ChaCha20.  Counters\
   and LFSRs are both acceptable ways of generating unique nonces, as is\
   encrypting a counter using a block cipher with a 64-bit block size\
   such as DES.  Note that it is not acceptable to use a truncation of a\
   counter encrypted with block ciphers with 128-bit or 256-bit blocks,\
   because such a truncation may repeat after a short time.\
\
   Consequences of repeating a nonce: If a nonce is repeated, then both\
   the one-time Poly1305 key and the keystream are identical between the\
   messages.  This reveals the XOR of the plaintexts, because the XOR of\
   the plaintexts is equal to the XOR of the ciphertexts.\
\
   The Poly1305 key MUST be unpredictable to an attacker.  Randomly\
   generating the key would fulfill this requirement, except that\
   Poly1305 is often used in communications protocols, so the receiver\
   should know the key.  Pseudorandom number generation such as by\
   encrypting a counter is acceptable.  Using ChaCha with a secret key\
   and a nonce is also acceptable.\
\
   The algorithms presented here were designed to be easy to implement\
   in constant time to avoid side-channel vulnerabilities.  The\
   operations used in ChaCha20 are all additions, XORs, and fixed rolls.\
   All of these can and should be implemented in constant time.  Access\
   to offsets into the ChaCha state and the number of operations do not\
   depend on any property of the key, eliminating the chance of\
   information about the key leaking through the timing of cache misses.\
\
   For Poly1305, the operations are addition, multiplication. and\
   modulus, all on numbers with greater than 128 bits.  This can be done\
   in constant time, but a naive implementation (such as using some\
   generic big number library) will not be constant time.  For example,\
   if the multiplication is performed as a separate operation from the\

\
\
   modulus, the result will sometimes be under 2^256 and sometimes be\
   above 2^256.  Implementers should be careful about timing side-\
   channels for Poly1305 by using the appropriate implementation of\
   these operations.\
\
   Validating the authenticity of a message involves a bitwise\
   comparison of the calculated tag with the received tag.  In most use\
   cases, nonces and AAD contents are not "used up" until a valid\
   message is received.  This allows an attacker to send multiple\
   identical messages with different tags until one passes the tag\
   comparison.  This is hard if the attacker has to try all 2^128\
   possible tags one by one.  However, if the timing of the tag\
   comparison operation reveals how long a prefix of the calculated and\
   received tags is identical, the number of messages can be reduced\
   significantly.  For this reason, with online protocols,\
   implementation MUST use a constant-time comparison function rather\
   than relying on optimized but insecure library functions such as the\
   C language's memcmp().\
\
   Additionally, any protocol using this algorithm MUST include the\
   complete tag to minimize the opportunity for forgery.  Tag truncation\
   MUST NOT be done.\
\
5.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has updated the entry in the "Authenticated Encryption with\
   Associated Data (AEAD) Parameters" registry with 29 as the Numeric ID\
   and "AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305" as the name to point to this document as\
   its reference.\

A.3.  Poly1305 Message Authentication Code\
\
   Notice how, in test vector #2, r is equal to zero.  The part of the\
   Poly1305 algorithm where the accumulator is multiplied by r means\
   that with r equal zero, the tag will be equal to s regardless of the\
   content of the text.  Fortunately, all the proposed methods of\
   generating r are such that getting this particular weak key is very\
   unlikely.\

   (assuming that it validates) decrypt the ciphertext.  In this\
   particular protocol, we'll assume that there is no padding of the\
   plaintext.\

                Parallel NFS (pNFS) Flexible File Layout\
\
Abstract\
\
   Parallel NFS (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto a\
   metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.  The\
   flexible file layout type is defined in this document as an extension\
   to pNFS that allows the use of storage devices that require only a\
   limited degree of interaction with the metadata server and use\
   already-existing protocols.  Client-side mirroring is also added to\
   provide replication of files.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   In Parallel NFS (pNFS), the metadata server returns layout type\
   structures that describe where file data is located.  There are\
   different layout types for different storage systems and methods of\
   arranging data on storage devices.  This document defines the\
   flexible file layout type used with file-based data servers that are\
   accessed using the NFS protocols: NFSv3 [RFC1813], NFSv4.0 [RFC7530],\
   NFSv4.1 [RFC5661], and NFSv4.2 [RFC7862].\
\
   To provide a global state model equivalent to that of the files\
   layout type, a back-end control protocol might be implemented between\
   the metadata server and NFSv4.1+ storage devices.  An implementation\
   can either define its own proprietary mechanism or it could define a\
   control protocol in a Standards Track document.  The requirements for\
   a control protocol are specified in [RFC5661] and clarified in\
   [RFC8434].\
\
   The control protocol described in this document is based on NFS.  It\
   does not provide for knowledge of stateids to be passed between the\
   metadata server and the storage devices.  Instead, the storage\
   devices are configured such that the metadata server has full access\
   rights to the data file system and then the metadata server uses\
   synthetic ids to control client access to individual files.\
\
   In traditional mirroring of data, the server is responsible for\
   replicating, validating, and repairing copies of the data file.  With\
   client-side mirroring, the metadata server provides a layout that\
   presents the available mirrors to the client.  The client then picks\
   a mirror to read from and ensures that all writes go to all mirrors.\
   The client only considers the write transaction to have succeeded if\
   all mirrors are successfully updated.  In case of error, the client\
   can use the LAYOUTERROR operation to inform the metadata server,\
   which is then responsible for the repairing of the mirrored copies of\
   the file.\

\
\
1.1.  Definitions\
\
   control communication requirements:  the specification for\
      information on layouts, stateids, file metadata, and file data\
      that must be communicated between the metadata server and the\
      storage devices.  There is a separate set of requirements for each\
      layout type.\
\
   control protocol:  the particular mechanism that an implementation of\
      a layout type would use to meet the control communication\
      requirement for that layout type.  This need not be a protocol as\
      normally understood.  In some cases, the same protocol may be used\
      as a control protocol and storage protocol.\
\
   client-side mirroring:  a feature in which the client, not the\
      server, is responsible for updating all of the mirrored copies of\
      a layout segment.\
\
   (file) data:  that part of the file system object that contains the\
      data to be read or written.  It is the contents of the object\
      rather than the attributes of the object.\
\
   data server (DS):  a pNFS server that provides the file's data when\
      the file system object is accessed over a file-based protocol.\
\
   fencing:  the process by which the metadata server prevents the\
      storage devices from processing I/O from a specific client to a\
      specific file.\
\
   file layout type:  a layout type in which the storage devices are\
      accessed via the NFS protocol (see Section 13 of [RFC5661]).\
\
   gid:  the group id, a numeric value that identifies to which group a\
      file belongs.\
\
   layout:  the information a client uses to access file data on a\
      storage device.  This information includes specification of the\
      protocol (layout type) and the identity of the storage devices to\
      be used.\
\
   layout iomode:  a grant of either read-only or read/write I/O to the\
      client.\
\
   layout segment:  a sub-division of a layout.  That sub-division might\
      be by the layout iomode (see Sections 3.3.20 and 12.2.9 of\
      [RFC5661]), a striping pattern (see Section 13.3 of [RFC5661]), or\
      requested byte range.\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   layout stateid:  a 128-bit quantity returned by a server that\
      uniquely defines the layout state provided by the server for a\
      specific layout that describes a layout type and file (see\
      Section 12.5.2 of [RFC5661]).  Further, Section 12.5.3 of\
      [RFC5661] describes differences in handling between layout\
      stateids and other stateid types.\
\
   layout type:  a specification of both the storage protocol used to\
      access the data and the aggregation scheme used to lay out the\
      file data on the underlying storage devices.\
\
   loose coupling:  when the control protocol is a storage protocol.\
\
   (file) metadata:  the part of the file system object that contains\
      various descriptive data relevant to the file object, as opposed\
      to the file data itself.  This could include the time of last\
      modification, access time, EOF position, etc.\
\
   metadata server (MDS):  the pNFS server that provides metadata\
      information for a file system object.  It is also responsible for\
      generating, recalling, and revoking layouts for file system\
      objects, for performing directory operations, and for performing\
      I/O operations to regular files when the clients direct these to\
      the metadata server itself.\
\
   mirror:  a copy of a layout segment.  Note that if one copy of the\
      mirror is updated, then all copies must be updated.\
\
   recalling a layout:  a graceful recall, via a callback, of a specific\
      layout by the metadata server to the client.  Graceful here means\
      that the client would have the opportunity to flush any WRITEs,\
      etc., before returning the layout to the metadata server.\
\
   revoking a layout:  an invalidation of a specific layout by the\
      metadata server.  Once revocation occurs, the metadata server will\
      not accept as valid any reference to the revoked layout, and a\
      storage device will not accept any client access based on the\
      layout.\
\
   resilvering:  the act of rebuilding a mirrored copy of a layout\
      segment from a known good copy of the layout segment.  Note that\
      this can also be done to create a new mirrored copy of the layout\
      segment.\
\
   rsize:  the data transfer buffer size used for READs.\

\
\
   stateid:  a 128-bit quantity returned by a server that uniquely\
      defines the set of locking-related state provided by the server.\
      Stateids may designate state related to open files, byte-range\
      locks, delegations, or layouts.\
\
   storage device:  the target to which clients may direct I/O requests\
      when they hold an appropriate layout.  See Section 2.1 of\
      [RFC8434] for further discussion of the difference between a data\
      server and a storage device.\
\
   storage protocol:  the protocol used by clients to do I/O operations\
      to the storage device.  Each layout type specifies the set of\
      storage protocols.\
\
   tight coupling:  an arrangement in which the control protocol is one\
      designed specifically for control communication.  It may be either\
      a proprietary protocol adapted specifically to a particular\
      metadata server or a protocol based on a Standards Track document.\
\
   uid:  the user id, a numeric value that identifies which user owns a\
      file.\
\
   wsize:  the data transfer buffer size used for WRITEs.\
\
1.2.  Requirements Language\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
2.  Coupling of Storage Devices\
\
   A server implementation may choose either a loosely coupled model or\
   a tightly coupled model between the metadata server and the storage\
   devices.  [RFC8434] describes the general problems facing pNFS\
   implementations.  This document details how the new flexible file\
   layout type addresses these issues.  To implement the tightly coupled\
   model, a control protocol has to be defined.  As the flexible file\
   layout imposes no special requirements on the client, the control\
   protocol will need to provide:\
\
   (1)  management of both security and LAYOUTCOMMITs and\
\
   (2)  a global stateid model and management of these stateids.\
\
\

\
RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   When implementing the loosely coupled model, the only control\
   protocol will be a version of NFS, with no ability to provide a\
   global stateid model or to prevent clients from using layouts\
   inappropriately.  To enable client use in that environment, this\
   document will specify how security, state, and locking are to be\
   managed.\
\
2.1.  LAYOUTCOMMIT\
\
   Regardless of the coupling model, the metadata server has the\
   responsibility, upon receiving a LAYOUTCOMMIT (see Section 18.42 of\
   [RFC5661]) to ensure that the semantics of pNFS are respected (see\
   Section 3.1 of [RFC8434]).  These do include a requirement that data\
   written to a data storage device be stable before the occurrence of\
   the LAYOUTCOMMIT.\
\
   It is the responsibility of the client to make sure the data file is\
   stable before the metadata server begins to query the storage devices\
   about the changes to the file.  If any WRITE to a storage device did\
   not result with stable_how equal to FILE_SYNC, a LAYOUTCOMMIT to the\
   metadata server MUST be preceded by a COMMIT to the storage devices\
   written to.  Note that if the client has not done a COMMIT to the\
   storage device, then the LAYOUTCOMMIT might not be synchronized to\
   the last WRITE operation to the storage device.\
\
2.2.  Fencing Clients from the Storage Device\
\
   With loosely coupled storage devices, the metadata server uses\
   synthetic uids (user ids) and gids (group ids) for the data file,\
   where the uid owner of the data file is allowed read/write access and\
   the gid owner is allowed read-only access.  As part of the layout\
   (see ffds_user and ffds_group in Section 5.1), the client is provided\
   with the user and group to be used in the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)\
   [RFC5531] credentials needed to access the data file.  Fencing off of\
   clients is achieved by the metadata server changing the synthetic uid\
   and/or gid owners of the data file on the storage device to\
   implicitly revoke the outstanding RPC credentials.  A client\
   presenting the wrong credential for the desired access will get an\
   NFS4ERR_ACCESS error.\
\
   With this loosely coupled model, the metadata server is not able to\
   fence off a single client; it is forced to fence off all clients.\
   However, as the other clients react to the fencing, returning their\
   layouts and trying to get new ones, the metadata server can hand out\
   a new uid and gid to allow access.\
\
\
\
\
\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   It is RECOMMENDED to implement common access control methods at the\
   storage device file system to allow only the metadata server root\
   (super user) access to the storage device and to set the owner of all\
   directories holding data files to the root user.  This approach\
   provides a practical model to enforce access control and fence off\
   cooperative clients, but it cannot protect against malicious clients;\
   hence, it provides a level of security equivalent to AUTH_SYS.  It is\
   RECOMMENDED that the communication between the metadata server and\
   storage device be secure from eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle\
   protocol tampering.  The security measure could be physical security\
   (e.g., the servers are co-located in a physically secure area),\
   encrypted communications, or some other technique.\
\
   With tightly coupled storage devices, the metadata server sets the\
   user and group owners, mode bits, and Access Control List (ACL) of\
   the data file to be the same as the metadata file.  And the client\
   must authenticate with the storage device and go through the same\
   authorization process it would go through via the metadata server.\
   In the case of tight coupling, fencing is the responsibility of the\
   control protocol and is not described in detail in this document.\
   However, implementations of the tightly coupled locking model (see\
   Section 2.3) will need a way to prevent access by certain clients to\
   specific files by invalidating the corresponding stateids on the\
   storage device.  In such a scenario, the client will be given an\
   error of NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID.\
\
   The client need not know the model used between the metadata server\
   and the storage device.  It need only react consistently to any\
   errors in interacting with the storage device.  It should both return\
   the layout and error to the metadata server and ask for a new layout.\
   At that point, the metadata server can either hand out a new layout,\
   hand out no layout (forcing the I/O through it), or deny the client\
   further access to the file.\
\
2.2.1.  Implementation Notes for Synthetic uids/gids\
\
   The selection method for the synthetic uids and gids to be used for\
   fencing in loosely coupled storage devices is strictly an\
   implementation issue.  That is, an administrator might restrict a\
   range of such ids available to the Lightweight Directory Access\
   Protocol (LDAP) 'uid' field [RFC4519].  The administrator might also\
   be able to choose an id that would never be used to grant access.\
   Then, when the metadata server had a request to access a file, a\
   SETATTR would be sent to the storage device to set the owner and\
   group of the data file.  The user and group might be selected in a\
   round-robin fashion from the range of available ids.\
\
\
\
\
\
Halevy & Haynes              Standards Track                    [Page 8]\
\
RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   Those ids would be sent back as ffds_user and ffds_group to the\
   client, who would present them as the RPC credentials to the storage\
   device.  When the client is done accessing the file and the metadata\
   server knows that no other client is accessing the file, it can reset\
   the owner and group to restrict access to the data file.\
\
   When the metadata server wants to fence off a client, it changes the\
   synthetic uid and/or gid to the restricted ids.  Note that using a\
   restricted id ensures that there is a change of owner and at least\
   one id available that never gets allowed access.\
\
   Under an AUTH_SYS security model, synthetic uids and gids of 0 SHOULD\
   be avoided.  These typically either grant super access to files on a\
   storage device or are mapped to an anonymous id.  In the first case,\
   even if the data file is fenced, the client might still be able to\
   access the file.  In the second case, multiple ids might be mapped to\
   the anonymous ids.\
\
2.2.2.  Example of Using Synthetic uids/gids\
\
   The user loghyr creates a file "ompha.c" on the metadata server,\
   which then creates a corresponding data file on the storage device.\
\
   The metadata server entry may look like:\
\
   -rw-r--r--    1 loghyr  staff    1697 Dec  4 11:31 ompha.c\
\
   On the storage device, the file may be assigned some unpredictable\
   synthetic uid/gid to deny access:\
\
   -rw-r-----    1 19452   28418    1697 Dec  4 11:31 data_ompha.c\
\
   When the file is opened on a client and accessed, the user will try\
   to get a layout for the data file.  Since the layout knows nothing\
   about the user (and does not care), it does not matter whether the\
   user loghyr or garbo opens the file.  The client has to present an\
   uid of 19452 to get write permission.  If it presents any other value\
   for the uid, then it must give a gid of 28418 to get read access.\
\
   Further, if the metadata server decides to fence the file, it should\
   change the uid and/or gid such that these values neither match\
   earlier values for that file nor match a predictable change based on\
   an earlier fencing.\
\
   -rw-r-----    1 19453   28419    1697 Dec  4 11:31 data_ompha.c\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   The set of synthetic gids on the storage device should be selected\
   such that there is no mapping in any of the name services used by the\
   storage device, i.e., each group should have no members.\
\
   If the layout segment has an iomode of LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ, then the\
   metadata server should return a synthetic uid that is not set on the\
   storage device.  Only the synthetic gid would be valid.\
\
   The client is thus solely responsible for enforcing file permissions\
   in a loosely coupled model.  To allow loghyr write access, it will\
   send an RPC to the storage device with a credential of 1066:1067.  To\
   allow garbo read access, it will send an RPC to the storage device\
   with a credential of 1067:1067.  The value of the uid does not matter\
   as long as it is not the synthetic uid granted when getting the\
   layout.\
\
   While pushing the enforcement of permission checking onto the client\
   may seem to weaken security, the client may already be responsible\
   for enforcing permissions before modifications are sent to a server.\
   With cached writes, the client is always responsible for tracking who\
   is modifying a file and making sure to not coalesce requests from\
   multiple users into one request.\
\
2.3.  State and Locking Models\
\
   An implementation can always be deployed as a loosely coupled model.\
   There is, however, no way for a storage device to indicate over an\
   NFS protocol that it can definitively participate in a tightly\
   coupled model:\
\
   o  Storage devices implementing the NFSv3 and NFSv4.0 protocols are\
      always treated as loosely coupled.\
\
   o  NFSv4.1+ storage devices that do not return the\
      EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS flag set to EXCHANGE_ID are indicating\
      that they are to be treated as loosely coupled.  From the locking\
      viewpoint, they are treated in the same way as NFSv4.0 storage\
      devices.\
\
   o  NFSv4.1+ storage devices that do identify themselves with the\
      EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_PNFS_DS flag set to EXCHANGE_ID can potentially\
      be tightly coupled.  They would use a back-end control protocol to\
      implement the global stateid model as described in [RFC5661].\
\
   A storage device would have to be either discovered or advertised\
   over the control protocol to enable a tightly coupled model.\

\
\
2.3.1.  Loosely Coupled Locking Model\
\
   When locking-related operations are requested, they are primarily\
   dealt with by the metadata server, which generates the appropriate\
   stateids.  When an NFSv4 version is used as the data access protocol,\
   the metadata server may make stateid-related requests of the storage\
   devices.  However, it is not required to do so, and the resulting\
   stateids are known only to the metadata server and the storage\
   device.\
\
   Given this basic structure, locking-related operations are handled as\
   follows:\
\
   o  OPENs are dealt with by the metadata server.  Stateids are\
      selected by the metadata server and associated with the client ID\
      describing the client's connection to the metadata server.  The\
      metadata server may need to interact with the storage device to\
      locate the file to be opened, but no locking-related functionality\
      need be used on the storage device.\
\
      OPEN_DOWNGRADE and CLOSE only require local execution on the\
      metadata server.\
\
   o  Advisory byte-range locks can be implemented locally on the\
      metadata server.  As in the case of OPENs, the stateids associated\
      with byte-range locks are assigned by the metadata server and only\
      used on the metadata server.\
\
   o  Delegations are assigned by the metadata server that initiates\
      recalls when conflicting OPENs are processed.  No storage device\
      involvement is required.\
\
   o  TEST_STATEID and FREE_STATEID are processed locally on the\
      metadata server, without storage device involvement.\
\
   All I/O operations to the storage device are done using the anonymous\
   stateid.  Thus, the storage device has no information about the\
   openowner and lockowner responsible for issuing a particular I/O\
   operation.  As a result:\
\
   o  Mandatory byte-range locking cannot be supported because the\
      storage device has no way of distinguishing I/O done on behalf of\
      the lock owner from those done by others.\
\
   o  Enforcement of share reservations is the responsibility of the\
      client.  Even though I/O is done using the anonymous stateid, the\
      client must ensure that it has a valid stateid associated with the\
      openowner.\
\

\
RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   In the event that a stateid is revoked, the metadata server is\
   responsible for preventing client access, since it has no way of\
   being sure that the client is aware that the stateid in question has\
   been revoked.\
\
   As the client never receives a stateid generated by a storage device,\
   there is no client lease on the storage device and no prospect of\
   lease expiration, even when access is via NFSv4 protocols.  Clients\
   will have leases on the metadata server.  In dealing with lease\
   expiration, the metadata server may need to use fencing to prevent\
   revoked stateids from being relied upon by a client unaware of the\
   fact that they have been revoked.\
\
2.3.2.  Tightly Coupled Locking Model\
\
   When locking-related operations are requested, they are primarily\
   dealt with by the metadata server, which generates the appropriate\
   stateids.  These stateids must be made known to the storage device\
   using control protocol facilities, the details of which are not\
   discussed in this document.\
\
   Given this basic structure, locking-related operations are handled as\
   follows:\
\
   o  OPENs are dealt with primarily on the metadata server.  Stateids\
      are selected by the metadata server and associated with the client\
      ID describing the client's connection to the metadata server.  The\
      metadata server needs to interact with the storage device to\
      locate the file to be opened and to make the storage device aware\
      of the association between the metadata-server-chosen stateid and\
      the client and openowner that it represents.\
\
      OPEN_DOWNGRADE and CLOSE are executed initially on the metadata\
      server, but the state change made must be propagated to the\

      the metadata server and are available for use on the metadata\
      server.  To enable mandatory lock enforcement on the storage\
      device, the metadata server needs the ability to make the storage\
      device aware of the association between the metadata-server-chosen\
      stateid and the client, openowner, and lock (i.e., lockowner,\
      byte-range, and lock-type) that it represents.  Because I/O\
      operations are allowed to present lock stateids, this information\
      needs to be propagated to all storage devices to which I/O might\
      be directed rather than only to storage device that contain the\
      locked region.\
\
   o  Delegations are assigned by the metadata server that initiates\
      recalls when conflicting OPENs are processed.  Because I/O\
      operations are allowed to present delegation stateids, the\
      metadata server requires the ability (1) to make the storage\
      device aware of the association between the metadata-server-chosen\
      stateid and the filehandle and delegation type it represents and\
      (2) to break such an association.\
\
   o  TEST_STATEID is processed locally on the metadata server, without\
      storage device involvement.\
\
   o  FREE_STATEID is processed on the metadata server, but the metadata\
      server requires the ability to propagate the request to the\
      corresponding storage devices.\
\
   Because the client will possess and use stateids valid on the storage\
   device, there will be a client lease on the storage device, and the\
   possibility of lease expiration does exist.  The best approach for\
   the storage device is to retain these locks as a courtesy.  However,\
   if it does not do so, control protocol facilities need to provide the\
   means to synchronize lock state between the metadata server and\
   storage device.\
\
   Clients will also have leases on the metadata server that are subject\
   to expiration.  In dealing with lease expiration, the metadata server\
   would be expected to use control protocol facilities enabling it to\
   invalidate revoked stateids on the storage device.  In the event the\
   client is not responsive, the metadata server may need to use fencing\
   to prevent revoked stateids from being acted upon by the storage\
   device.\

3.  XDR Description of the Flexible File Layout Type\
\
   This document contains the External Data Representation (XDR)\
   [RFC4506] description of the flexible file layout type.  The XDR\
   description is embedded in this document in a way that makes it\
   simple for the reader to extract into a ready-to-compile form.  The\

\
\
   reader can feed this document into the following shell script to\
   produce the machine-readable XDR description of the flexible file\
   layout type:\
\
   <CODE BEGINS>\
\
   #!/bin/sh\
   grep '^ *///' $* | sed 's?^ */// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'\
\
   <CODE ENDS>\
\
   That is, if the above script is stored in a file called "extract.sh"\
   and this document is in a file called "spec.txt", then the reader can\
   do:\
\
   sh extract.sh < spec.txt > flex_files_prot.x\
\
   The effect of the script is to remove leading white space from each\
   line, plus a sentinel sequence of "///".\
\
   The embedded XDR file header follows.  Subsequent XDR descriptions\
   with the sentinel sequence are embedded throughout the document.\
\
   Note that the XDR code contained in this document depends on types\
   from the NFSv4.1 nfs4_prot.x file [RFC5662].  This includes both nfs\
   types that end with a 4, such as offset4, length4, etc., as well as\
   more generic types such as uint32_t and uint64_t.\
\
3.1.  Code Components Licensing Notice\
\
   Both the XDR description and the scripts used for extracting the XDR\
   description are Code Components as described in Section 4 of "Trust\
   Legal Provisions (TLP)" [LEGAL].  These Code Components are licensed\
   according to the terms of that document.\

\
4.  Device Addressing and Discovery\
\
   Data operations to a storage device require the client to know the\
   network address of the storage device.  The NFSv4.1+ GETDEVICEINFO\
   operation (Section 18.40 of [RFC5661]) is used by the client to\
   retrieve that information.\
\
4.1.  ff_device_addr4\
\
   The ff_device_addr4 data structure is returned by the server as the\
   layout-type-specific opaque field da_addr_body in the device_addr4\
   structure by a successful GETDEVICEINFO operation.\
\
   <CODE BEGINS>\
\
   /// struct ff_device_versions4 {\
   ///         uint32_t        ffdv_version;\
   ///         uint32_t        ffdv_minorversion;\
   ///         uint32_t        ffdv_rsize;\
   ///         uint32_t        ffdv_wsize;\
   ///         bool            ffdv_tightly_coupled;\
   /// };\
   ///\
\
   /// struct ff_device_addr4 {\
   ///         multipath_list4     ffda_netaddrs;\
   ///         ff_device_versions4 ffda_versions<>;\
   /// };\
   ///\
\
   <CODE ENDS>\
\
   The ffda_netaddrs field is used to locate the storage device.  It\
   MUST be set by the server to a list holding one or more of the device\
   network addresses.\
\
   The ffda_versions array allows the metadata server to present choices\
   as to NFS version, minor version, and coupling strength to the\
   client.  The ffdv_version and ffdv_minorversion represent the NFS\
   protocol to be used to access the storage device.  This layout\
   specification defines the semantics for ffdv_versions 3 and 4.  If\
   ffdv_version equals 3, then the server MUST set ffdv_minorversion to\
   0 and ffdv_tightly_coupled to false.  The client MUST then access the\
   storage device using the NFSv3 protocol [RFC1813].  If ffdv_version\
   equals 4, then the server MUST set ffdv_minorversion to one of the\
   NFSv4 minor version numbers, and the client MUST access the storage\
   device using NFSv4 with the specified minor version.\
\
\

\
RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   Note that while the client might determine that it cannot use any of\
   the configured combinations of ffdv_version, ffdv_minorversion, and\
   ffdv_tightly_coupled, when it gets the device list from the metadata\
   server, there is no way to indicate to the metadata server as to\
   which device it is version incompatible.  However, if the client\
   waits until it retrieves the layout from the metadata server, it can\
   at that time clearly identify the storage device in question (see\
   Section 5.4).\
\
   The ffdv_rsize and ffdv_wsize are used to communicate the maximum\
   rsize and wsize supported by the storage device.  As the storage\
   device can have a different rsize or wsize than the metadata server,\
   the ffdv_rsize and ffdv_wsize allow the metadata server to\
   communicate that information on behalf of the storage device.\
\
   ffdv_tightly_coupled informs the client as to whether or not the\
   metadata server is tightly coupled with the storage devices.  Note\
   that even if the data protocol is at least NFSv4.1, it may still be\
   the case that there is loose coupling in effect.  If\
   ffdv_tightly_coupled is not set, then the client MUST commit writes\
   to the storage devices for the file before sending a LAYOUTCOMMIT to\
   the metadata server.  That is, the writes MUST be committed by the\
   client to stable storage via issuing WRITEs with stable_how ==\
   FILE_SYNC or by issuing a COMMIT after WRITEs with stable_how !=\
   FILE_SYNC (see Section 3.3.7 of [RFC1813]).\
\
4.2.  Storage Device Multipathing\
\
   The flexible file layout type supports multipathing to multiple\
   storage device addresses.  Storage-device-level multipathing is used\
   for bandwidth scaling via trunking and for higher availability of use\
   in the event of a storage device failure.  Multipathing allows the\
   client to switch to another storage device address that may be that\
   of another storage device that is exporting the same data stripe\
   unit, without having to contact the metadata server for a new layout.\
\
   To support storage device multipathing, ffda_netaddrs contains an\
   array of one or more storage device network addresses.  This array\
   (data type multipath_list4) represents a list of storage devices\
   (each identified by a network address), with the possibility that\
   some storage device will appear in the list multiple times.\
\
   The client is free to use any of the network addresses as a\
   destination to send storage device requests.  If some network\
   addresses are less desirable paths to the data than others, then the\
   metadata server SHOULD NOT include those network addresses in\
   ffda_netaddrs.  If less desirable network addresses exist to provide\
   failover, the RECOMMENDED method to offer the addresses is to provide\

\
\
   them in a replacement device-ID-to-device-address mapping or a\
   replacement device ID.  When a client finds no response from the\
   storage device using all addresses available in ffda_netaddrs, it\
   SHOULD send a GETDEVICEINFO to attempt to replace the existing\
   device-ID-to-device-address mappings.  If the metadata server detects\
   that all network paths represented by ffda_netaddrs are unavailable,\
   the metadata server SHOULD send a CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID (if the client\
   has indicated it wants device ID notifications for changed device\
   IDs) to change the device-ID-to-device-address mappings to the\
   available addresses.  If the device ID itself will be replaced, the\
   metadata server SHOULD recall all layouts with the device ID and thus\
   force the client to get new layouts and device ID mappings via\
   LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO.\
\
   Generally, if two network addresses appear in ffda_netaddrs, they\
   will designate the same storage device.  When the storage device is\
   accessed over NFSv4.1 or a higher minor version, the two storage\
   device addresses will support the implementation of client ID or\
   session trunking (the latter is RECOMMENDED) as defined in [RFC5661].\
   The two storage device addresses will share the same server owner or\
   major ID of the server owner.  It is not always necessary for the two\
   storage device addresses to designate the same storage device with\
   trunking being used.  For example, the data could be read-only, and\
   the data consist of exact replicas.\
\
5.  Flexible File Layout Type\
\
   The original layouttype4 introduced in [RFC5662] is modified to be:\

           LAYOUT4_OSD2_OBJECTS    = 2,\
           LAYOUT4_BLOCK_VOLUME    = 3,\

       };\

\
   The ff_layout4 structure specifies a layout in that portion of the\
   data file described in the current layout segment.  It is either a\
   single instance or a set of mirrored copies of that portion of the\
   data file.  When mirroring is in effect, it protects against loss of\
   data in layout segments.\
\
   While not explicitly shown in the above XDR, each layout4 element\
   returned in the logr_layout array of LAYOUTGET4res (see\
   Section 18.43.2 of [RFC5661]) describes a layout segment.  Hence,\
   each ff_layout4 also describes a layout segment.  It is possible that\
   the file is concatenated from more than one layout segment.  Each\
   layout segment MAY represent different striping parameters.\
\
   The ffl_stripe_unit field is the stripe unit size in use for the\
   current layout segment.  The number of stripes is given inside each\
   mirror by the number of elements in ffm_data_servers.  If the number\
   of stripes is one, then the value for ffl_stripe_unit MUST default to\
   zero.  The only supported mapping scheme is sparse and is detailed in\
   Section 6.  Note that there is an assumption here that both the\
   stripe unit size and the number of stripes are the same across all\
   mirrors.\
\
   The ffl_mirrors field is the array of mirrored storage devices that\
   provide the storage for the current stripe; see Figure 1.\
\
   The ffl_stats_collect_hint field provides a hint to the client on how\
   often the server wants it to report LAYOUTSTATS for a file.  The time\
   is in seconds.\

   The ffs_mirrors field represents an array of state information for\
   each mirrored copy of the current layout segment.  Each element is\
   described by a ff_mirror4 type.\
\
   ffds_deviceid provides the deviceid of the storage device holding the\
   data file.\
\
   ffds_fh_vers is an array of filehandles of the data file matching the\
   available NFS versions on the given storage device.  There MUST be\
   exactly as many elements in ffds_fh_vers as there are in\
   ffda_versions.  Each element of the array corresponds to a particular\
   combination of ffdv_version, ffdv_minorversion, and\
   ffdv_tightly_coupled provided for the device.  The array allows for\
   server implementations that have different filehandles for different\
   combinations of version, minor version, and coupling strength.  See\
   Section 5.4 for how to handle versioning issues between the client\
   and storage devices.\
\
   For tight coupling, ffds_stateid provides the stateid to be used by\
   the client to access the file.  For loose coupling and an NFSv4\
   storage device, the client will have to use an anonymous stateid to\
   perform I/O on the storage device.  With no control protocol, the\
   metadata server stateid cannot be used to provide a global stateid\
   model.  Thus, the server MUST set the ffds_stateid to be the\
   anonymous stateid.\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   This specification of the ffds_stateid restricts both models for\
   NFSv4.x storage protocols:\
\
   loosely coupled model:  the stateid has to be an anonymous stateid\
\
   tightly coupled model:  the stateid has to be a global stateid\
\
   A number of issues stem from a mismatch between the fact that\
   ffds_stateid is defined as a single item while ffds_fh_vers is\
   defined as an array.  It is possible for each open file on the\
   storage device to require its own open stateid.  Because there are\
   established loosely coupled implementations of the version of the\
   protocol described in this document, such potential issues have not\
   been addressed here.  It is possible for future layout types to be\
   defined that address these issues, should it become important to\
   provide multiple stateids for the same underlying file.\
\
   For loosely coupled storage devices, ffds_user and ffds_group provide\
   the synthetic user and group to be used in the RPC credentials that\
   the client presents to the storage device to access the data files.\
   For tightly coupled storage devices, the user and group on the\
   storage device will be the same as on the metadata server; that is,\
   if ffdv_tightly_coupled (see Section 4.1) is set, then the client\
   MUST ignore both ffds_user and ffds_group.\
\
   The allowed values for both ffds_user and ffds_group are specified as\
   owner and owner_group, respectively, in Section 5.9 of [RFC5661].\
   For NFSv3 compatibility, user and group strings that consist of\
   decimal numeric values with no leading zeros can be given a special\
   interpretation by clients and servers that choose to provide such\
   support.  The receiver may treat such a user or group string as\
   representing the same user as would be represented by an NFSv3 uid or\
   gid having the corresponding numeric value.  Note that if using\
   Kerberos for security, the expectation is that these values will be a\
   name@domain string.\
\
   ffds_efficiency describes the metadata server's evaluation as to the\
   effectiveness of each mirror.  Note that this is per layout and not\
   per device as the metric may change due to perceived load,\
   availability to the metadata server, etc.  Higher values denote\
   higher perceived utility.  The way the client can select the best\
   mirror to access is discussed in Section 8.1.\
\
   ffl_flags is a bitmap that allows the metadata server to inform the\
   client of particular conditions that may result from more or less\
   tight coupling of the storage devices.\

\
\
   FF_FLAGS_NO_LAYOUTCOMMIT:  can be set to indicate that the client is\
      not required to send LAYOUTCOMMIT to the metadata server.\
\
   FF_FLAGS_NO_IO_THRU_MDS:  can be set to indicate that the client\
      should not send I/O operations to the metadata server.  That is,\
      even if the client could determine that there was a network\
      disconnect to a storage device, the client should not try to proxy\
      the I/O through the metadata server.\
\
   FF_FLAGS_NO_READ_IO:  can be set to indicate that the client should\
      not send READ requests with the layouts of iomode\
      LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW.  Instead, it should request a layout of iomode\
      LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ from the metadata server.\
\
   FF_FLAGS_WRITE_ONE_MIRROR:  can be set to indicate that the client\
      only needs to update one of the mirrors (see Section 8.2).\
\
5.1.1.  Error Codes from LAYOUTGET\
\
   [RFC5661] provides little guidance as to how the client is to proceed\
   with a LAYOUTGET that returns an error of either\
   NFS4ERR_LAYOUTTRYLATER, NFS4ERR_LAYOUTUNAVAILABLE, and NFS4ERR_DELAY.\
   Within the context of this document:\
\
   NFS4ERR_LAYOUTUNAVAILABLE:  there is no layout available and the I/O\
      is to go to the metadata server.  Note that it is possible to have\
      had a layout before a recall and not after.\
\
   NFS4ERR_LAYOUTTRYLATER:  there is some issue preventing the layout\
      from being granted.  If the client already has an appropriate\
      layout, it should continue with I/O to the storage devices.\
\
   NFS4ERR_DELAY:  there is some issue preventing the layout from being\
      granted.  If the client already has an appropriate layout, it\
      should not continue with I/O to the storage devices.\
\
5.1.2.  Client Interactions with FF_FLAGS_NO_IO_THRU_MDS\
\
   Even if the metadata server provides the FF_FLAGS_NO_IO_THRU_MDS\
   flag, the client can still perform I/O to the metadata server.  The\
   flag functions as a hint.  The flag indicates to the client that the\
   metadata server prefers to separate the metadata I/O from the data I/\
   O, most likely for performance reasons.\

\
\
5.2.  LAYOUTCOMMIT\
\
   The flexible file layout does not use lou_body inside the\
   loca_layoutupdate argument to LAYOUTCOMMIT.  If lou_type is\
   LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES, the lou_body field MUST have a zero length (see\
   Section 18.42.1 of [RFC5661]).\
\
5.3.  Interactions between Devices and Layouts\
\
   In [RFC5661], the file layout type is defined such that the\
   relationship between multipathing and filehandles can result in\
   either 0, 1, or N filehandles (see Section 13.3).  Some rationales\
   for this are clustered servers that share the same filehandle or\
   allow for multiple read-only copies of the file on the same storage\
   device.  In the flexible file layout type, while there is an array of\
   filehandles, they are independent of the multipathing being used.  If\
   the metadata server wants to provide multiple read-only copies of the\
   same file on the same storage device, then it should provide multiple\
   mirrored instances, each with a different ff_device_addr4.  The\
   client can then determine that, since the each of the ffds_fh_vers\
   are different, there are multiple copies of the file for the current\
   layout segment available.\
\
5.4.  Handling Version Errors\
\
   When the metadata server provides the ffda_versions array in the\
   ff_device_addr4 (see Section 4.1), the client is able to determine\
   whether or not it can access a storage device with any of the\
   supplied combinations of ffdv_version, ffdv_minorversion, and\
   ffdv_tightly_coupled.  However, due to the limitations of reporting\
   errors in GETDEVICEINFO (see Section 18.40 in [RFC5661]), the client\
   is not able to specify which specific device it cannot communicate\
   with over one of the provided ffdv_version and ffdv_minorversion\
   combinations.  Using ff_ioerr4 (see Section 9.1.1) inside either the\
   LAYOUTRETURN (see Section 18.44 of [RFC5661]) or the LAYOUTERROR (see\
   Section 15.6 of [RFC7862] and Section 10 of this document), the\
   client can isolate the problematic storage device.\
\
   The error code to return for LAYOUTRETURN and/or LAYOUTERROR is\
   NFS4ERR_MINOR_VERS_MISMATCH.  It does not matter whether the mismatch\
   is a major version (e.g., client can use NFSv3 but not NFSv4) or\
   minor version (e.g., client can use NFSv4.1 but not NFSv4.2), the\
   error indicates that for all the supplied combinations for\
   ffdv_version and ffdv_minorversion, the client cannot communicate\
   with the storage device.  The client can retry the GETDEVICEINFO to\
   see if the metadata server can provide a different combination, or it\
   can fall back to doing the I/O through the metadata server.\

\
\
6.  Striping via Sparse Mapping\
\
   While other layout types support both dense and sparse mapping of\
   logical offsets to physical offsets within a file (see, for example,\
   Section 13.4 of [RFC5661]), the flexible file layout type only\
   supports a sparse mapping.\
\
   With sparse mappings, the logical offset within a file (L) is also\
   the physical offset on the storage device.  As detailed in\
   Section 13.4.4 of [RFC5661], this results in holes across each\
   storage device that does not contain the current stripe index.\
\
   L: logical offset within the file\
\
   W: stripe width\
       W = number of elements in ffm_data_servers\
\
   S: number of bytes in a stripe\
       S = W * ffl_stripe_unit\
\
   N: stripe number\
       N = L / S\
\
7.  Recovering from Client I/O Errors\
\
   The pNFS client may encounter errors when directly accessing the\
   storage devices.  However, it is the responsibility of the metadata\
   server to recover from the I/O errors.  When the LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES\
   layout type is used, the client MUST report the I/O errors to the\
   server at LAYOUTRETURN time using the ff_ioerr4 structure (see\
   Section 9.1.1).\
\
   The metadata server analyzes the error and determines the required\
   recovery operations such as recovering media failures or\
   reconstructing missing data files.\
\
   The metadata server MUST recall any outstanding layouts to allow it\
   exclusive write access to the stripes being recovered and to prevent\
   other clients from hitting the same error condition.  In these cases,\
   the server MUST complete recovery before handing out any new layouts\
   to the affected byte ranges.\
\
   Although the client implementation has the option to propagate a\
   corresponding error to the application that initiated the I/O\
   operation and drop any unwritten data, the client should attempt to\
   retry the original I/O operation by either requesting a new layout or\
   sending the I/O via regular NFSv4.1+ READ or WRITE operations to the\
   metadata server.  The client SHOULD attempt to retrieve a new layout\
\
\

\
RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   and retry the I/O operation using the storage device first and only\
   retry the I/O operation via the metadata server if the error\
   persists.\
\
8.  Mirroring\
\
   The flexible file layout type has a simple model in place for the\
   mirroring of the file data constrained by a layout segment.  There is\
   no assumption that each copy of the mirror is stored identically on\
   the storage devices.  For example, one device might employ\
   compression or deduplication on the data.  However, the over-the-wire\
   transfer of the file contents MUST appear identical.  Note, this is a\
   constraint of the selected XDR representation in which each mirrored\
   copy of the layout segment has the same striping pattern (see\
   Figure 1).\
\
   The metadata server is responsible for determining the number of\
   mirrored copies and the location of each mirror.  While the client\
   may provide a hint to how many copies it wants (see Section 12), the\
   metadata server can ignore that hint; in any event, the client has no\
   means to dictate either the storage device (which also means the\
   coupling and/or protocol levels to access the layout segments) or the\
   location of said storage device.\
\
   The updating of mirrored layout segments is done via client-side\
   mirroring.  With this approach, the client is responsible for making\
   sure modifications are made on all copies of the layout segments it\
   is informed of via the layout.  If a layout segment is being\
   resilvered to a storage device, that mirrored copy will not be in the\
   layout.  Thus, the metadata server MUST update that copy until the\
   client is presented it in a layout.  If the FF_FLAGS_WRITE_ONE_MIRROR\
   is set in ffl_flags, the client need only update one of the mirrors\
   (see Section 8.2).  If the client is writing to the layout segments\
   via the metadata server, then the metadata server MUST update all\
   copies of the mirror.  As seen in Section 8.3, during the\
   resilvering, the layout is recalled, and the client has to make\
   modifications via the metadata server.\
\
8.1.  Selecting a Mirror\
\
   When the metadata server grants a layout to a client, it MAY let the\
   client know how fast it expects each mirror to be once the request\
   arrives at the storage devices via the ffds_efficiency member.  While\
   the algorithms to calculate that value are left to the metadata\
   server implementations, factors that could contribute to that\
   calculation include speed of the storage device, physical memory\
   available to the device, operating system version, current load, etc.\
\
\
\
\
Halevy & Haynes              Standards Track                   [Page 26]\
\
RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   However, what should not be involved in that calculation is a\
   perceived network distance between the client and the storage device.\
   The client is better situated for making that determination based on\
   past interaction with the storage device over the different available\
   network interfaces between the two; that is, the metadata server\
   might not know about a transient outage between the client and\
   storage device because it has no presence on the given subnet.\
\
   As such, it is the client that decides which mirror to access for\
   reading the file.  The requirements for writing to mirrored layout\
   segments are presented below.\
\
8.2.  Writing to Mirrors\
\
8.2.1.  Single Storage Device Updates Mirrors\
\
   If the FF_FLAGS_WRITE_ONE_MIRROR flag in ffl_flags is set, the client\
   only needs to update one of the copies of the layout segment.  For\
   this case, the storage device MUST ensure that all copies of the\
   mirror are updated when any one of the mirrors is updated.  If the\
   storage device gets an error when updating one of the mirrors, then\
   it MUST inform the client that the original WRITE had an error.  The\
   client then MUST inform the metadata server (see Section 8.2.3).  The\
   client's responsibility with respect to COMMIT is explained in\
   Section 8.2.4.  The client may choose any one of the mirrors and may\
   use ffds_efficiency as described in Section 8.1 when making this\
   choice.\
\
8.2.2.  Client Updates All Mirrors\
\
   If the FF_FLAGS_WRITE_ONE_MIRROR flag in ffl_flags is not set, the\
   client is responsible for updating all mirrored copies of the layout\
   segments that it is given in the layout.  A single failed update is\
   sufficient to fail the entire operation.  If all but one copy is\
   updated successfully and the last one provides an error, then the\
   client needs to inform the metadata server about the error.  The\
   client can use either LAYOUTRETURN or LAYOUTERROR to inform the\
   metadata server that the update failed to that storage device.  If\
   the client is updating the mirrors serially, then it SHOULD stop at\
   the first error encountered and report that to the metadata server.\
   If the client is updating the mirrors in parallel, then it SHOULD\
   wait until all storage devices respond so that it can report all\
   errors encountered during the update.\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
8.2.3.  Handling Write Errors\
\
   When the client reports a write error to the metadata server, the\
   metadata server is responsible for determining if it wants to remove\
   the errant mirror from the layout, if the mirror has recovered from\
   some transient error, etc.  When the client tries to get a new\
   layout, the metadata server informs it of the decision by the\
   contents of the layout.  The client MUST NOT assume that the contents\
   of the previous layout will match those of the new one.  If it has\
   updates that were not committed to all mirrors, then it MUST resend\
   those updates to all mirrors.\
\
   There is no provision in the protocol for the metadata server to\
   directly determine that the client has or has not recovered from an\
   error.  For example, if a storage device was network partitioned from\
   the client and the client reported the error to the metadata server,\
   then the network partition would be repaired, and all of the copies\
   would be successfully updated.  There is no mechanism for the client\
   to report that fact, and the metadata server is forced to repair the\
   file across the mirror.\
\
   If the client supports NFSv4.2, it can use LAYOUTERROR and\
   LAYOUTRETURN to provide hints to the metadata server about the\
   recovery efforts.  A LAYOUTERROR on a file is for a non-fatal error.\
   A subsequent LAYOUTRETURN without a ff_ioerr4 indicates that the\
   client successfully replayed the I/O to all mirrors.  Any\
   LAYOUTRETURN with a ff_ioerr4 is an error that the metadata server\
   needs to repair.  The client MUST be prepared for the LAYOUTERROR to\
   trigger a CB_LAYOUTRECALL if the metadata server determines it needs\
   to start repairing the file.\
\
8.2.4.  Handling Write COMMITs\
\
   When stable writes are done to the metadata server or to a single\
   replica (if allowed by the use of FF_FLAGS_WRITE_ONE_MIRROR), it is\
   the responsibility of the receiving node to propagate the written\
   data stably, before replying to the client.\
\
   In the corresponding cases in which unstable writes are done, the\
   receiving node does not have any such obligation, although it may\
   choose to asynchronously propagate the updates.  However, once a\
   COMMIT is replied to, all replicas must reflect the writes that have\
   been done, and this data must have been committed to stable storage\
   on all replicas.\
\
\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   In order to avoid situations in which stale data is read from\
   replicas to which writes have not been propagated:\
\
   o  A client that has outstanding unstable writes made to single node\
      (metadata server or storage device) MUST do all reads from that\
      same node.\
\
   o  When writes are flushed to the server (for example, to implement\
      close-to-open semantics), a COMMIT must be done by the client to\
      ensure that up-to-date written data will be available irrespective\
      of the particular replica read.\
\
8.3.  Metadata Server Resilvering of the File\
\
   The metadata server may elect to create a new mirror of the layout\
   segments at any time.  This might be to resilver a copy on a storage\
   device that was down for servicing, to provide a copy of the layout\
   segments on storage with different storage performance\
   characteristics, etc.  As the client will not be aware of the new\
   mirror and the metadata server will not be aware of updates that the\
   client is making to the layout segments, the metadata server MUST\
   recall the writable layout segment(s) that it is resilvering.  If the\
   client issues a LAYOUTGET for a writable layout segment that is in\
   the process of being resilvered, then the metadata server can deny\
   that request with an NFS4ERR_LAYOUTUNAVAILABLE.  The client would\
   then have to perform the I/O through the metadata server.\
\
9.  Flexible File Layout Type Return\
\
   layoutreturn_file4 is used in the LAYOUTRETURN operation to convey\
   layout-type-specific information to the server.  It is defined in\
   Section 18.44.1 of [RFC5661] as follows:\
\
   <CODE BEGINS>\
\
      /* Constants used for LAYOUTRETURN and CB_LAYOUTRECALL */\
      const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE      = 1;\
      const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID      = 2;\
      const LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL       = 3;\
\
      enum layoutreturn_type4 {\
              LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FILE,\
              LAYOUTRETURN4_FSID = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_FSID,\
              LAYOUTRETURN4_ALL  = LAYOUT4_RET_REC_ALL\
      };\

\
   If the lora_layout_type layout type is LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES and the\
   lr_returntype is LAYOUTRETURN4_FILE, then the lrf_body opaque value\
   is defined by ff_layoutreturn4 (see Section 9.3).  This allows the\
   client to report I/O error information or layout usage statistics\
   back to the metadata server as defined below.  Note that while the\
   data structures are built on concepts introduced in NFSv4.2, the\
   effective discriminated union (lora_layout_type combined with\
   ff_layoutreturn4) allows for an NFSv4.1 metadata server to utilize\
   the data.\

\
   Recall that [RFC7862] defines device_error4 as:\
\
   <CODE BEGINS>\
\
   struct device_error4 {\
           deviceid4       de_deviceid;\
           nfsstat4        de_status;\
           nfs_opnum4      de_opnum;\
   };\
\
   <CODE ENDS>\
\
   The ff_ioerr4 structure is used to return error indications for data\
   files that generated errors during data transfers.  These are hints\
   to the metadata server that there are problems with that file.  For\
   each error, ffie_errors.de_deviceid, ffie_offset, and ffie_length\
   represent the storage device and byte range within the file in which\
   the error occurred; ffie_errors represents the operation and type of\
   error.  The use of device_error4 is described in Section 15.6 of\
   [RFC7862].\
\
   Even though the storage device might be accessed via NFSv3 and\
   reports back NFSv3 errors to the client, the client is responsible\
   for mapping these to appropriate NFSv4 status codes as de_status.\
   Likewise, the NFSv3 operations need to be mapped to equivalent NFSv4\
   operations.\

\
\
   Both operation counts and bytes transferred are kept in the\
   ff_io_latency4.  As seen in ff_layoutupdate4 (see Section 9.2.2),\
   READ and WRITE operations are aggregated separately.  READ operations\
   are used for the ff_io_latency4 ffl_read.  Both WRITE and COMMIT\
   operations are used for the ff_io_latency4 ffl_write.  "Requested"\
   counters track what the client is attempting to do, and "completed"\
   counters track what was done.  There is no requirement that the\
   client only report completed results that have matching requested\
   results from the reported period.\
\
   ffil_bytes_not_delivered is used to track the aggregate number of\
   bytes requested but not fulfilled due to error conditions.\
   ffil_total_busy_time is the aggregate time spent with outstanding RPC\
   calls. ffil_aggregate_completion_time is the sum of all round-trip\
   times for completed RPC calls.\
\
   In Section 3.3.1 of [RFC5661], the nfstime4 is defined as the number\
   of seconds and nanoseconds since midnight or zero hour January 1,\
   1970 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The use of nfstime4 in\
   ff_io_latency4 is to store time since the start of the first I/O from\
   the client after receiving the layout.  In other words, these are to\
   be decoded as duration and not as a date and time.\
\
   Note that LAYOUTSTATS are cumulative, i.e., not reset each time the\
   operation is sent.  If two LAYOUTSTATS operations for the same file\
   and layout stateid originate from the same NFS client and are\
   processed at the same time by the metadata server, then the one\
   containing the larger values contains the most recent time series\
   data.\

\
   ffl_addr differentiates which network address the client is connected\
   to on the storage device.  In the case of multipathing, ffl_fhandle\
   indicates which read-only copy was selected. ffl_read and ffl_write\
   convey the latencies for both READ and WRITE operations,\
   respectively.  ffl_duration is used to indicate the time period over\
   which the statistics were collected.  If true, ffl_local indicates\
   that the I/O was serviced by the client's cache.  This flag allows\
   the client to inform the metadata server about "hot" access to a file\
   it would not normally be allowed to report on.\

\
   <CODE ENDS>\
\
   With pNFS, data transfers are performed directly between the pNFS\
   client and the storage devices.  Therefore, the metadata server has\
   no direct knowledge of the I/O operations being done and thus cannot\
   create on its own statistical information about client I/O to\
   optimize the data storage location.  ff_iostats4 MAY be used by the\
   client to report I/O statistics back to the metadata server upon\
   returning the layout.\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   Since it is not feasible for the client to report every I/O that used\
   the layout, the client MAY identify "hot" byte ranges for which to\
   report I/O statistics.  The definition and/or configuration mechanism\
   of what is considered "hot" and the size of the reported byte range\
   are out of the scope of this document.  For client implementation,\
   providing reasonable default values and an optional run-time\
   management interface to control these parameters is suggested.  For\
   example, a client can define the default byte-range resolution to be\
   1 MB in size and the thresholds for reporting to be 1 MB/second or 10\
   I/O operations per second.\
\
   For each byte range, ffis_offset and ffis_length represent the\
   starting offset of the range and the range length in bytes.\
   ffis_read.ii_count, ffis_read.ii_bytes, ffis_write.ii_count, and\
   ffis_write.ii_bytes represent the number of contiguous READ and WRITE\
   I/Os and the respective aggregate number of bytes transferred within\
   the reported byte range.\
\
   The combination of ffis_deviceid and ffl_addr uniquely identifies\
   both the storage path and the network route to it.  Finally,\
   ffl_fhandle allows the metadata server to differentiate between\
   multiple read-only copies of the file on the same storage device.\
\
9.3.  ff_layoutreturn4\

   ///\

\
   When data file I/O operations fail, fflr_ioerr_report<> is used to\

   occurred on the data file identified by ffie_errors.de_deviceid.  If\
   no errors are to be reported, the size of the fflr_ioerr_report<>\
   array is set to zero.  The client MAY also use fflr_iostats_report<>\
   to report a list of I/O statistics as an array of elements of type\
   ff_iostats4.  Each element in the array represents statistics for a\
   particular byte range.  Byte ranges are not guaranteed to be disjoint\
   and MAY repeat or intersect.\

\
\
10.  Flexible File Layout Type LAYOUTERROR\
\
   If the client is using NFSv4.2 to communicate with the metadata\
   server, then instead of waiting for a LAYOUTRETURN to send error\
   information to the metadata server (see Section 9.1), it MAY use\
   LAYOUTERROR (see Section 15.6 of [RFC7862]) to communicate that\
   information.  For the flexible file layout type, this means that\
   LAYOUTERROR4args is treated the same as ff_ioerr4.\
\
11.  Flexible File Layout Type LAYOUTSTATS\
\
   If the client is using NFSv4.2 to communicate with the metadata\
   server, then instead of waiting for a LAYOUTRETURN to send I/O\
   statistics to the metadata server (see Section 9.2), it MAY use\
   LAYOUTSTATS (see Section 15.7 of [RFC7862]) to communicate that\
   information.  For the flexible file layout type, this means that\
   LAYOUTSTATS4args.lsa_layoutupdate is overloaded with the same\
   contents as in ffis_layoutupdate.\
\
12.  Flexible File Layout Type Creation Hint\
\
   The layouthint4 type is defined in the [RFC5661] as follows:\
\
   <CODE BEGINS>\
\
   struct layouthint4 {\
       layouttype4        loh_type;\
       opaque             loh_body<>;\
   };\
\
   <CODE ENDS>\
\
   The layouthint4 structure is used by the client to pass a hint about\
   the type of layout it would like created for a particular file.  If\
   the loh_type layout type is LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES, then the loh_body\
   opaque value is defined by the ff_layouthint4 type.\

\
   This type conveys hints for the desired data map.  All parameters are\
   optional so the client can give values for only the parameter it\
   cares about.\
\
13.  Recalling a Layout\
\
   While Section 12.5.5 of [RFC5661] discusses reasons independent of\
   layout type for recalling a layout, the flexible file layout type\
   metadata server should recall outstanding layouts in the following\
   cases:\
\
   o  When the file's security policy changes, i.e., ACLs or permission\
      mode bits are set.\
\
   o  When the file's layout changes, rendering outstanding layouts\
      invalid.\
\
   o  When existing layouts are inconsistent with the need to enforce\
      locking constraints.\
\
   o  When existing layouts are inconsistent with the requirements\
      regarding resilvering as described in Section 8.3.\
\
13.1.  CB_RECALL_ANY\
\
   The metadata server can use the CB_RECALL_ANY callback operation to\
   notify the client to return some or all of its layouts.  Section 22.3\
   of [RFC5661] defines the allowed types of the "NFSv4 Recallable\
   Object Types Registry".\
\
   <CODE BEGINS>\
\
   /// const RCA4_TYPE_MASK_FF_LAYOUT_MIN     = 16;\
   /// const RCA4_TYPE_MASK_FF_LAYOUT_MAX     = 17;\

   struct  CB_RECALL_ANY4args      {\
       uint32_t        craa_layouts_to_keep;\
       bitmap4         craa_type_mask;\
   };\

RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   <CODE ENDS>\
\
   Typically, CB_RECALL_ANY will be used to recall client state when the\
   server needs to reclaim resources.  The craa_type_mask bitmap\
   specifies the type of resources that are recalled, and the\
   craa_layouts_to_keep value specifies how many of the recalled\
   flexible file layouts the client is allowed to keep.  The mask flags\
   for the flexible file layout type are defined as follows:\
\
   <CODE BEGINS>\
\
   /// enum ff_cb_recall_any_mask {\
   ///     PNFS_FF_RCA4_TYPE_MASK_READ = 16,\
   ///     PNFS_FF_RCA4_TYPE_MASK_RW   = 17\
   /// };\
   ///\
\
   <CODE ENDS>\
\
   The flags represent the iomode of the recalled layouts.  In response,\
   the client SHOULD return layouts of the recalled iomode that it needs\
   the least, keeping at most craa_layouts_to_keep flexible file\
   layouts.\
\
   The PNFS_FF_RCA4_TYPE_MASK_READ flag notifies the client to return\
   layouts of iomode LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ.  Similarly, the\
   PNFS_FF_RCA4_TYPE_MASK_RW flag notifies the client to return layouts\
   of iomode LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW.  When both mask flags are set, the client\
   is notified to return layouts of either iomode.\
\
14.  Client Fencing\
\
   In cases where clients are uncommunicative and their lease has\
   expired or when clients fail to return recalled layouts within a\
   lease period, the server MAY revoke client layouts and reassign these\
   resources to other clients (see Section 12.5.5 of [RFC5661]).  To\
   avoid data corruption, the metadata server MUST fence off the revoked\
   clients from the respective data files as described in Section 2.2.\
\
15.  Security Considerations\
\
   The combination of components in a pNFS system is required to\
   preserve the security properties of NFSv4.1+ with respect to an\
   entity accessing data via a client.  The pNFS feature partitions the\
   NFSv4.1+ file system protocol into two parts: the control protocol\
   and the data protocol.  As the control protocol in this document is\
   NFS, the security properties are equivalent to the version of NFS\
   being used.  The flexible file layout further divides the data\
\

\
RFC 8435                pNFS Flexible File Layout            August 2018\
\
\
   protocol into metadata and data paths.  The security properties of\
   the metadata path are equivalent to those of NFSv4.1x (see Sections\
   1.7.1 and 2.2.1 of [RFC5661]).  And the security properties of the\
   data path are equivalent to those of the version of NFS used to\
   access the storage device, with the provision that the metadata\
   server is responsible for authenticating client access to the data\
   file.  The metadata server provides appropriate credentials to the\
   client to access data files on the storage device.  It is also\
   responsible for revoking access for a client to the storage device.\
\
   The metadata server enforces the file access control policy at\
   LAYOUTGET time.  The client should use RPC authorization credentials\
   for getting the layout for the requested iomode ((LAYOUTIOMODE4_READ\
   or LAYOUTIOMODE4_RW), and the server verifies the permissions and ACL\
   for these credentials, possibly returning NFS4ERR_ACCESS if the\
   client is not allowed the requested iomode.  If the LAYOUTGET\
   operation succeeds, the client receives, as part of the layout, a set\
   of credentials allowing it I/O access to the specified data files\
   corresponding to the requested iomode.  When the client acts on I/O\
   operations on behalf of its local users, it MUST authenticate and\
   authorize the user by issuing respective OPEN and ACCESS calls to the\
   metadata server, similar to having NFSv4 data delegations.\
\
   The combination of filehandle, synthetic uid, and gid in the layout\
   is the way that the metadata server enforces access control to the\
   data server.  The client only has access to filehandles of file\
   objects and not directory objects.  Thus, given a filehandle in a\
   layout, it is not possible to guess the parent directory filehandle.\
   Further, as the data file permissions only allow the given synthetic\
   uid read/write permission and the given synthetic gid read\
   permission, knowing the synthetic ids of one file does not\
   necessarily allow access to any other data file on the storage\
   device.\
\
   The metadata server can also deny access at any time by fencing the\
   data file, which means changing the synthetic ids.  In turn, that\
   forces the client to return its current layout and get a new layout\
   if it wants to continue I/O to the data file.\
\
   If access is allowed, the client uses the corresponding (read-only or\
   read/write) credentials to perform the I/O operations at the data\
   file's storage devices.  When the metadata server receives a request\
   to change a file's permissions or ACL, it SHOULD recall all layouts\
   for that file and then MUST fence off any clients still holding\
   outstanding layouts for the respective files by implicitly\
   invalidating the previously distributed credential on all data file\
   comprising the file in question.  It is REQUIRED that this be done\
   before committing to the new permissions and/or ACL.  By requesting\

\
\
   new layouts, the clients will reauthorize access against the modified\
   access control metadata.  Recalling the layouts in this case is\
   intended to prevent clients from getting an error on I/Os done after\
   the client was fenced off.\
\
15.1.  RPCSEC_GSS and Security Services\
\
   Because of the special use of principals within the loosely coupled\
   model, the issues are different depending on the coupling model.\
\
15.1.1.  Loosely Coupled\
\
   RPCSEC_GSS version 3 (RPCSEC_GSSv3) [RFC7861] contains facilities\
   that would allow it to be used to authorize the client to the storage\
   device on behalf of the metadata server.  Doing so would require that\
   each of the metadata server, storage device, and client would need to\
   implement RPCSEC_GSSv3 using an RPC-application-defined structured\
   privilege assertion in a manner described in Section 4.9.1 of\
   [RFC7862].  The specifics necessary to do so are not described in\
   this document.  This is principally because any such specification\
   would require extensive implementation work on a wide range of\
   storage devices, which would be unlikely to result in a widely usable\
   specification for a considerable time.\
\
   As a result, the layout type described in this document will not\
   provide support for use of RPCSEC_GSS together with the loosely\
   coupled model.  However, future layout types could be specified,\
   which would allow such support, either through the use of\
   RPCSEC_GSSv3 or in other ways.\
\
15.1.2.  Tightly Coupled\
\
   With tight coupling, the principal used to access the metadata file\
   is exactly the same as used to access the data file.  The storage\
   device can use the control protocol to validate any RPC credentials.\
   As a result, there are no security issues related to using RPCSEC_GSS\
   with a tightly coupled system.  For example, if Kerberos V5 Generic\
   Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) [RFC4121] is\
   used as the security mechanism, then the storage device could use a\
   control protocol to validate the RPC credentials to the metadata\
   server.\
\
16.  IANA Considerations\
\
   [RFC5661] introduced the "pNFS Layout Types Registry"; new layout\
   type numbers in this registry need to be assigned by IANA.  This\
   document defines the protocol associated with an existing layout type\
   number: LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES.  See Table 1.\

             A Simpler Method for Resolving Alert-Info URNs\
\
Abstract\
\
   The "alert" namespace of Uniform Resource Names (URNs) can be used in\
   the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
   requests and responses to inform a voice over IP (VoIP) telephone\
   (user agent) of the characteristics of the call that the user agent\
   has originated or terminated.  The user agent must resolve the URNs\
   into a signal; that is, it must select the best available signal to\
   present to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call.\
\
   RFC 7462 describes a non-normative algorithm for signal selection.\
   This document describes a more efficient alternative algorithm: a\
   user agent's designer can, based on the user agent's signals and\
   their meanings, construct a finite state machine (FSM) to process the\
   URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given in\
   the definition of the "alert" URN namespace.\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   When a SIP user agent (UA) server receives an incoming INVITE\
   request, it chooses an alerting signal (the ring tone) to present to\
   its user (the called user) by processing the Alert-Info header\
   field(s) in the incoming INVITE request [RFC3261].  Similarly, a SIP\
   UA client determines an alerting signal (the ringback tone) to\
   present to its user (the calling user) by processing the Alert-Info\
   header field(s) in the incoming provisional response(s) to its\
   outgoing INVITE request.\
\
   [RFC3261] envisioned that the Alert-Info header field value would be\
   a URL that the UA could use to retrieve the encoded media of the\
   signal.  This usage has security problems and is inconvenient to\
   implement in practice.\
\
   [RFC7462] introduced an alternative practice: the Alert-Info values\
   can be URNs in the "alert" URN namespace that specify features of the\
   call or of the signal that should be signaled to the user.  [RFC7462]\
   defined a large set of "alert" URNs and procedures for extending\
   the set.\
\
   A UA is unlikely to provide more than a small set of alerting\
   signals, and there are an infinite number of possible combinations of\
   "alert" URNs.  Thus, a UA is often required to select an alerting\
   signal that renders only a subset of the information in the\
   Alert-Info header field(s) -- which is the resolution process for\
   "alert" URNs.  The requirements for resolving "alert" URNs are given\
   in Section 11.1 of [RFC7462].\
\
   Section 12 of [RFC7462] gives a (non-normative) resolution algorithm\
   for selecting a signal that satisfies the requirements of\
   Section 11.1 of that document.  That algorithm can be used regardless\
   of the set of alerting signals that the UA provides and their\
   specified meanings.  The existence of the algorithm defined in\
   [RFC7462] demonstrates that the resolution requirements can always be\
   satisfied.  However, the algorithm is complex and slow.\
\
   The purpose of this document is to describe an improved\
   implementation -- a more efficient resolution algorithm for selecting\
   signals that conforms to the requirements of Section 11.1 of\
   [RFC7462].  (Of course, like any such algorithm, it is non-normative,\
   and the implementation is free to use any algorithm that conforms to\
   the requirements of Section 11.1 of [RFC7462].)\
\
   In the algorithm defined in this document, once the UA designer has\
   chosen the set of signals that the UA produces and the "alert" URNs\
   that they express, a finite state machine (FSM) is constructed that\
\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   selects alerting signals based on the URNs in the Alert-Info header\
   field(s) in a SIP message.  The incoming "alert" URNs are\
   preprocessed in a straightforward manner into a sequence of "symbols"\
   drawn from a fixed finite set; these symbols are then used as input\
   to the FSM.  After processing the input, the state of the FSM selects\
   the correct alerting signal to present to the user.\
\
   Both the preprocessor and the FSM are determined only by the selected\
   set of signals and the set of "alert" URNs expressed by the signals,\
   so the processing machinery can be fixed at the time of designing\
   the UA.\
\
1.1.  Requirements Governing Resolution Algorithms\
\
   The requirements for the resolution of "alert" URNs are given in\
   Section 11.1 of [RFC7462] and can be described as follows:\
\
   o  The "alert" URNs are processed from left to right.  Each "alert"\
      URN has precedence over all URNs that follow it, and its\
      interpretation is subordinate to all URNs that precede it.\
\
   o  As each URN is processed, one of the UA's signals is chosen that\
      expresses that URN as far as can be done without reducing the\
      degree to which any of the preceding URNs were expressed by the\
      signal chosen for the preceding URN.  Thus, as processing\
      proceeds, the chosen signals become increasingly specific and\
      contain more information, but all of the information about a\
      particular URN that is expressed by the signal chosen for that URN\
      is also expressed by the signals chosen for all following URNs.\
\
   o  If the entirety of the current URN cannot be expressed by any\
      allowed signal, then each of the trailing alert-ind-parts (the\
      sections separated by colons) is in turn removed until the reduced\
      URN can be expressed by some signal that also expresses at least\
      the same reduced versions of the preceding URNs that were\
      expressed by the signal chosen for the preceding URN.  This can be\
      described as "a signal that expresses as much of the current URN\
      as possible while still expressing as much of the previous URNs as\
      the preceding signal did."\
\
   So, for instance, consider processing\
\
       Alert-Info: urn:alert:category-a:part-a1:part-a2,\
                   urn:alert:category-b:part-b1:part-b2\
\
   If the UA has no signal for urn:alert:category-a:part-a1:part-a2, it\
   removes part-a2 from the URN and checks whether it has a signal for\
   the less-specific URN urn:alert:category-a:part-a1.  If it has no\
\
\
\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   signal for that URN, it gives up on the URN entirely (since\
   urn:alert:category-a doesn't exist and can be considered to express\
   nothing about the call), and the chosen signal is the default signal\
   of the UA, i.e., the signal that is used when there is no Alert-Info.\
\
   But let us suppose the UA has a signal for\
   urn:alert:category-a:part-a1 and chooses that signal when processing\
   the first URN.  All processing after this point will be restricted to\
   signals that express urn:alert:category-a:part-a1 or a more specific\
   URN of the category "category-a".\
\
   The UA then goes on to examine the next URN,\
   urn:alert:category-b:part-b1:part-b2.  If there is a signal that\
   expresses both urn:alert:category-a:part-a1 and\
   urn:alert:category-b:part-b1:part-b2, then the UA chooses that\
   signal.  If there is no such signal, the second URN is reduced to\
   urn:alert:category-b:part-b1, and the UA checks for a signal that\
   expresses that URN along with urn:alert:category-a:part-a1.  If there\
   is no such signal that matches that relaxed requirement, the second\
   URN is reduced to urn:alert:category-b, which is discarded, and the\
   chosen signal for the first URN is chosen for the second URN.  In any\
   case, all processing after this point will be restricted to signals\
   that express urn:alert:category-a:part-a1 or a more specific URN of\
   the category "category-a" and that also express the chosen part of\
   urn:alert:category-b:part-b1:part-b2.\
\
   This process is continued until the last "alert" URN is processed;\
   the signal chosen for the last URN is the signal that the UA uses.\
\
1.2.  Summary of the New Resolution Algorithm\
\
   The purpose of this document is to describe a resolution algorithm\
   that conforms to Section 11.1 of [RFC7462] but is simpler than the\
   algorithm described in Section 12 of [RFC7462]: once the UA designer\
   has chosen a set of signals and the URNs that they express, an FSM is\
   constructed that selects alerting signals based on the URNs in the\
   Alert-Info header field(s) in a SIP message.\
\
   o  The designer selects the set of signals that the UA produces,\
      matching each signal to a set of "alert" URNs that together\
      specify the meaning that is carried by the signal.  (If the signal\
      is a "default" signal that has no specific meaning, the set is\
      empty.  If the signal carries the meaning of one "alert" URN, the\
      set contains that URN.  If the signal carries a meaning that is\
      the logical AND of two or more "alert" URNs, the set contains\
      those URNs.)\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   o  Based on the UA's signals and their meanings, the designer\
      constructs an "alphabet" containing a finite number of symbols;\
      each possible "alert" URN is mapped into one particular symbol.\
\
   o  The designer constructs an FSM whose input is the alphabet of\
      symbols and whose states describe the information extracted from\
      the Alert-Info URNs.\
\
   o  Each state of the FSM has an associated signal.  Processing the\
      Alert-Info URNs will leave the FSM in some particular state; the\
      UA renders the signal that is attached to that final state.\
\
   To select a ring tone or ringback tone based on a SIP message, the UA\
   processes the "alert" URNs in the Alert-Info header field from left\
   to right.  Initially, the FSM is in a designated initial state.  The\
   UA maps each successive URN into the corresponding symbol and then\
   executes the state transition of the FSM specified by the symbol.\
   The state of the FSM after processing the URNs determines which\
   signal the UA will render to the user.\
\
   Note that the UA generally has two FSMs, because a UA usually wants\
   to signal different information in ring tones than it signals in\
   ringback tones.  One FSM is used to select the ring tone to render\
   for an incoming INVITE request.  The other FSM is used to select the\
   ringback tone to render based on an incoming provisional response to\
   an outgoing INVITE request.  Both FSMs are constructed in the same\
   way, but the constructions are based on different lists of signals\
   and corresponding URNs.\
\
   All of the steps of the method after the designer has selected the\
   signals and their URNs are algorithmic, and the algorithm of those\
   steps ensures that the operation of the FSM will satisfy the\
   constraints of Section 11.1 of [RFC7462].  A Python implementation of\
   the algorithmic steps is provided in [code].\
\
   In simple situations, a suitable FSM or equivalent ad hoc code can be\
   constructed by hand using ad hoc analysis.  Generally, this is only\
   practical in situations where a small number of alert-categories and\
   alert-indications are signaled and the categories interact in a\
   simple, uniform way.  For example, the examples in Sections 5.1 and\
   5.2 could be constructed by ad hoc analysis.  But automatic\
   processing is valuable if the situation is too complicated to\
   construct a correct FSM by ad hoc analysis, or if the set of signals\
   will change too frequently for human production to be economical.\

1.3.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
2.  Selecting the Signals and Their Corresponding "alert" URNs\
\
   The designer must select signals that the UA will generate and define\
   the meanings that the signals will have to the user.  Based on this,\
   the designer determines for each signal the "alert" URN or\
   combination of "alert" URNs that (1) indicate that signal's meaning\
   in SIP messages and (2) consequently should elicit that signal from\
   the UA.\
\
   For example, suppose the UA has a particular ring tone for calls from\
   an external source.  A call from an external source is marked with\
   the URN urn:alert:source:external (specified in Section 9 of\
   [RFC7462]).  Thus, the table of signals includes:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    -------------------------------\
       external source                 urn:alert:source:external\
\
   Similarly, if the UA has a particular ring tone for calls from an\
   internal source, the table includes:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    -------------------------------\
       internal source                 urn:alert:source:internal\
\
   If the UA has ring tones for calls that are marked as having higher\

       low priority                    urn:alert:priority:low\
\
   Note that the UA must be able to signal for a message that has no\
   "alert" URNs in the Alert-Info header field, which means that there\
   must always be a default signal that has zero corresponding URNs:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\

\
\
   A signal can be defined to indicate a combination of conditions.  For\
   instance, a signal that is used only for high-priority, internal-\
   source calls expresses two URNs and will only be used when both URNs\
   are present in Alert-Info:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ------------------------------  -------------------------------\
       high priority, internal source  urn:alert:priority:high,\
                                           urn:alert:source:internal\
\
   A signal can be defined to cover a number of related conditions by\
   specifying a URN that is the common prefix of the URNs for the\
   various conditions.  For instance, the URNs for "recall due to\
   callback", "recall due to call hold", and "recall due to transfer"\
   all start with urn:alert:service:recall, and so one signal can be\
   provided for all of them by:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    -------------------------------\
       recall                          urn:alert:service:recall\
\
   But if a specific signal is also provided for "recall due to\
   callback" by this entry:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    ---------------------------------\
       recall generally                urn:alert:service:recall\
       recall due to callback          urn:alert:service:recall:callback\
\
   then if the message contains urn:alert:service:recall:callback, the\
   "recall due to callback" signal will be chosen instead of "recall\
   generally" because the UA chooses the signal that most completely\
   expresses the information in the Alert-Info header field.\
\
   The designer may wish to define extension URNs that provide more\
   specific information about a call than the standard "alert" URNs do.\
   One method is to add additional components to standard URNs.  For\
   instance, an extra-high priority could be indicated by the URN\
   urn:alert:priority:high:extra@example.  The final "extra@example" is\
   an "alert-ind-part" that is a private extension.  (See Sections 7 and\
   10.2 of [RFC7462] for a discussion of private extensions.)  In any\
   case, adding an alert-ind-part to a URN makes its meaning more\
   specific, in that any call to which the longer URN can be applied can\
   also have the shorter URN applied.  In this case, "extra-high-\
   priority calls" are considered a subset of "high-priority calls".\

       extra-high priority   urn:alert:priority:high:extra@example.com\
\
   Of course, for this extension to be useful, the senders of SIP\
   messages (e.g., other UAs) must generate the extension URN in\
   suitable circumstances.\
\
   In some circumstances, the designer may want to create an entirely\
   new category of "alert" URNs to indicate a type of information that\
   is not indicated by any standard category of URNs.  In that case, the\
   designer uses a private extension as the alert-category (the third\
   component of the URN), combined with whatever alert-ind-part (fourth\
   component) values are desired.  For example, a simplified version of\
   the U.S. military security designations could be:\
\
       Signal                    URN(s)\
       -----------------------   ---------------------------------------\
       unclassified              urn:alert:security@example:unclassified\
       confidential              urn:alert:security@example:confidential\
       secret                    urn:alert:security@example:secret\
       top secret                urn:alert:security@example:top-secret\
\
   The designer should ensure that the new alert-category is orthogonal\
   to all defined standard alert-categories, in that any combination of\
   one of the new URNs with one of the standard URNs is meaningful in\
   that there could be a message carrying both URNs.\
\
   In addition, the set of alert-ind-parts for the new alert-category\
   should be comprehensive and disjoint, in that every message can be\
   described by exactly one of them.\
\
3.  General Considerations for Processing Alert-Info\
\
   In this section, we will discuss various considerations that arise\
   when processing Alert-Info.  These have to be taken care of properly\
   in order to conform to the standards, as well as to ensure a good\
   user experience.  But since they are largely independent of the\
   generated FSM and its processing, they are gathered here in a\
   separate section.\
\
   The UA may have a number of different FSMs for processing URNs.\
   Generally, there will be different FSMs for processing Alert-Info in\
   incoming INVITE requests and for incoming provisional responses to\
   outgoing INVITE requests.  But any situation that changes the set of\
   signals that the UA is willing to generate specifies a different set\
   of signals and corresponding URNs and thus generates a different FSM.\
\
\
\
Worley                        Informational                     [Page 9]\
\
RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   For example, if a call is active on the UA, all audible signals may\
   become unavailable, or audible signals may be available only if\
   urn:alert:priority:high is specified.\
\
   Similarly, if the set of signals is customized by user action or\
   local policy, the generated FSM must be updated.  This can be done by\
   (1) regenerating it according to the method described here or\
   (2) generating a "generic" FSM and instantiating it based on the\
   available signals.  (See Section 7 for a discussion of this.)\
\
   Note that the values in an Alert-Info header field are allowed to be\
   URIs of any scheme and, within the "urn" scheme, are allowed to have\
   any namespace [RFC3261].  The processing of URIs that are not "alert"\
   URNs is not considered by this document, nor is that processing\
   specified by [RFC7462].  But the algorithm designer must consider\
   what to do with such URIs if they are encountered.  The simplest\
   choice is to ignore them.  Alternatively, the algorithm may examine\
   the URI to determine if it names an alerting signal or describes how\
   to retrieve an alerting signal, and, if so, choose to render that\
   signal rather than process the "alert" URNs to select a signal.  In\
   any case, the remainder of this document assumes that (1) the signal\
   is to be chosen based on the "alert" URNs in Alert-Info and (2) all\
   Alert-Info URIs that are not "alert" URNs have been removed.\
\
   The UA may also receive "alert" URNs that are semantically invalid in\
   various ways.  For example, the URN may have only three components,\
   despite the fact that all valid "alert" URNs have at least one\
   alert-ind-part and thus four components.  The only useful strategy is\
   to ignore such URNs (and possibly log them for analysis).\
\
   The method described here is robust in its handling of categories and\
   alert-ind-parts that are unknown to the UA; as a consequence, it is\
   also robust if they are not valid standardized URNs.  Thus, these\
   error conditions need not be handled specially.\
\
4.  Constructing the Finite State Machine for a Very Simple Example\
\
   Constructing the FSM involves:\
\
   1.  Listing the URNs that are expressed by the various signals of\
       the UA.\
\
   2.  From the expressed URNs, constructing the finite alphabet of\
       symbols into which input URNs are mapped and that drive the state\
       transitions of the FSM.\
\
\
\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   3.  Constructing the states of the FSM and the transitions between\
       them.\
\
   4.  Selecting a signal to be associated with each FSM state.\
\
   We will explain the process using a very simple example in which\
   there are two signals -- one expressing "internal source" and one\
   expressing "external source" -- along with a default signal (for when\
   there is no source information to signal).  The "internal source"\
   signal expresses urn:alert:source:internal, and the "external source"\
   signal expresses urn:alert:source:external.\
\
4.1.  Listing the Expressed URNs\
\
   The first step is to establish for each of the UA's signals what call\
   characteristics it represents, which is to say, the set of "alert"\
   URNs that are its information content.\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    -------------------------------\
       default                         (none)\
       internal source                 urn:alert:source:internal\
       external source                 urn:alert:source:external\
\
   From the totality of these expressed URNs, the designer can then\
   determine which sets of URNs must be distinguished from each other.\
   In our simple example, the expressed URNs are:\
\
       urn:alert:source:external\
       urn:alert:source:internal\
\
4.2.  Constructing the Alphabet of Symbols\
\
   In order to reduce the infinite set of possible "alert" URNs to a\
   finite alphabet of input symbols that cause the FSM's transitions,\
   the designer must partition the "alert" URNs into a finite set of\
   categories.\
\
   Once we've listed all the expressed URNs, we can list all of the\
   alert-categories that are relevant to the UA's signaling; "alert"\
   URNs in any other alert-category cannot affect the signaling and can\
   be ignored.  (The easiest way to ignore the non-relevant URNs is to\
   skip over them during Alert-Info processing.  A more formal method is\
   to map all of them into one "Other" symbol and then, for each state\
   of the FSM, have the "Other" symbol transition to that same state.)\
\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   Within each relevant alert-category, we now define a distinct\
   symbol for every expressed URN and for all of their "ancestor" URNs\
   (those that can be created by removing one or more trailing\
   alert-ind-parts).  In order to name the symbols in a way that\
   distinguishes them from the corresponding URNs, we remove the initial\
   "urn:alert:" and capitalize each alert-ind-part.  Thus, in our\
   example, we get these symbols:\
\
       Source\
       Source:External\
       Source:Internal\
\
   Note that there is a "Source" symbol even though there is no\
   corresponding URN.  (urn:alert:source is not a valid URN -- see\
   Section 7 of [RFC7462] -- although the processing algorithm must be\
   prepared to screen out such a purported URN if it appears in the\
   Alert-Info header field.)  However, its existence as a symbol will be\
   useful later when we construct the FSM.\
\
   For each of these symbols, we add a symbol that classifies URNs that\
   extend the symbol's corresponding URN with alert-ind-parts that\
   cannot be expressed by signals:\
\
       Source:Other\
       Source:External:Other\
       Source:Internal:Other\
\
   The latter two classify URNs, such as\
   urn:alert:source:external:foo@example, that extend URNs that we\
   already have symbols for.  The first is for classifying URNs, such as\
   urn:alert:source:bar@example, that have first alert-ind-parts that\
   contradict all the "source" URNs that the UA can signal.\
\
   These steps give us this set of symbols:\
\
       Source\
       Source:External\
       Source:External:Other\
       Source:Internal\
       Source:Internal:Other\
       Source:Other\
\
   We can then simplify the set of symbols by removing the ones like\
   Source:External:Other and Source:Internal:Other that consist of\
   adding "Other" to a symbol that corresponds to an expressed URN that\
   is not ancestral to any other expressed URNs.  This works because\
   adding further alert-ind-parts to a URN that is a leaf in regard to\

\
\
   the set of signals has no additional effect.  In this example,\
   urn:alert:source:external:foo@example has the same effect as\
   urn:alert:source:external for both (1) causing a signal to be chosen\
   and (2) suppressing the effect of later URNs.\
\
   This leaves the following symbols for the "source" category:\
\
       Source\
       Source:External\
       Source:Internal\
       Source:Other\
\
   These can be visually summarized by showing the infinite tree of\
   possible source "alert" URNs and how it is partitioned into subtrees\
   that map to each of these symbols.  We also mark with "*" the\
   expressed URNs.\
\
                                urn:alert\
                                    |\
                                {   |    }\
                                { source } --> 1\
                                {   |    }\
                                    |\
               +--------------------+------------------+\
               |                    |                  |\
          {    |      }        {    |      }        {  |  }\
          { external* } --> 2  { internal* } --> 3  { ... } --> 4\
          {    |      }        {    |      }        {     }\
          {   ...     }        {   ...     }\
          {           }        {           }\
\
       1 = Source\
       2 = Source:External\
       3 = Source:Internal\
       4 = Source:Other\
\
4.3.  Constructing the States and Transitions\
\
   The UA processes the Alert-Info URNs from left to right using an FSM,\
   with each successive URN causing the FSM to transition to a new\
   state.  Each state of the FSM records the information that has so far\
   been extracted from the URNs.  The state of the FSM after processing\
   all the URNs determines which signal the UA will render to the user.\
\
   We label each state with a set of symbols, one from each relevant\
   category, that describe the information that's been extracted from\
   all of the URNs that have so far been processed.  The initial state\
   is labeled with the "null" symbols that are just the category names,\
\
\
\
Worley                        Informational                    [Page 13]\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   because no information has yet been recorded.  In our simple example,\
   the initial state is labeled "Source", since that's the only relevant\
   category.\
\
       State: Source (initial state)\
\
   Each state has a corresponding alerting signal, which is the signal\
   that the UA will produce when URN processing leaves the FSM in that\
   state.  The signal is the one that best expresses the information\
   that has been extracted from the URNs.  Usually, the choice of signal\
   is obvious to the designer, but there are certain constraints that\
   the choice must satisfy.  The main constraint is that the signal's\
   expressed URNs must be semantic supersets of (i.e., identical to or a\
   prefix of) the URNs corresponding to the symbols in the state's\
   label.  In particular, if the expressed URN of the signal in a\
   certain category is shorter than the state's label, we show that in\
   the state's name by putting parentheses around the trailing part of\
   the symbol that is not expressed by the signal.  For instance, if the\
   symbol in the label is "Source:External" but the signal only\
   expresses "Source" (i.e., no "source" URN at all), then the symbol in\
   the label is modified to be "Source:(External)".\
\
   The reason for this nonintuitive construction is that in some states,\
   the FSM has recorded information that the chosen signal cannot\
   express.\
\
   Note that the parentheses are part of the state name, so in some\
   circumstances there may be two or more distinct states labeled with\
   the same symbols but with different placement of parentheses within\
   the symbols.  These similar state names are relevant when the FSM can\
   record information from multiple "alert" URNs but cannot express all\
   of them -- depending on the order in which the URNs appear, the UA\
   may have to render different signals, so it needs states that record\
   the same information but render different subsets of that\
   information.\
\
   The initial state's label is the string of null symbols for the\
   relevant categories, so the only allowed signal is the default\
   signal, which expresses no URNs:\
\
       State: Source (initial state)\
       Signal: default\
\
\
\
\
\
\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   From each state, we must construct the transition for each possible\
   input symbol.  For a particular current state and symbol, we\
   construct the label of the next state by combining the input symbol\
   with the symbol in the current state's label for the same category.\
   If one of the symbols is a prefix of the other, we select the longer\
   one; if not, we select the symbol in the current state's label.\
\
   Thus, in our simple example, the initial state has the following\
   transitions:\
\
       State: Source (initial state)\
       Signal: default\
       Transitions:\
           Source:External -> Source:External\
           Source:Internal -> Source:Internal\
           Source:Other -> Source:Other\
\
   In all of these transitions, the input symbol is compatible with the\
   matching label of the current state, "Source", so the next state's\
   label is the full input symbol.\
\
   However, there is a further constraint on the next state: its signal\
   must express URNs that at least contain the expressed URNs of the\
   signal of the current state.  Within that constraint, and being\
   compatible with the next state's label, for the category of the input\
   URN, the next state's signal must express the longest URN that can be\
   expressed by any signal.\
\
   In our example, this means that the next Source:External state has\
   the "external source" signal, which expresses\
   urn:alert:source:external.  Since that signal expresses all of the\
   state's label, it is the chosen state.  Similarly, the next\
   Source:Internal state has the "internal source" signal.  But for the\
   transition on input Source:Other, the "Source:Other" state must have\
   the default signal, as there is no signal that expresses\
   urn:alert:source:[some-unknown-alert-ind-part].  So the next state is\
   "Source:(Other)", where the parentheses record that the "Other" part\
   of the label is not expressed by the state's signal.\

   Thus, the current state and the next states that it can transition\
   to are:\
\
       State: Source (initial state)\
       Signal: default\
       Transitions:\
           Source:External -> Source:External\
           Source:Internal -> Source:Internal\

   Looking at the state Source:External, we see that it is incompatible\

   its transitions are to itself:\

4.4.  Summary\
\
   The FSM can be constructed by processing the file "very-simple.txt"\
   with the program "alert-info-fsm.py" in [code].  The program's output\
   shows the stages of the construction, which are as follows:\
\
   1.  The signals have the meanings:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    -------------------------------\
       default                         (none)\
       internal source                 urn:alert:source:internal\
       external source                 urn:alert:source:external\
\
   2.  The expressed URNs are:\
\
       urn:alert:source:external\
       urn:alert:source:internal\
\
   3.  The relevant categories of "alert" URNs are only:\
\
       source\
\
   4.  Thus, the infinite universe of possible "alert" URNs can be\
       reduced to these symbols, which are the categories of URNs that\
       are different in ways that are significant to the resolution\
       process:\
\
       Source\
       Source:External\
       Source:Internal\
       Source:Other\
\
   5.  The FSM is:\
\
       State: Source (initial state)\
       Signal: default\
       Transitions:\
           Source:External -> Source:External\
           Source:Internal -> Source:Internal\
           Source:Other -> Source:(Other)\
\
       State: Source:External\
       Signal: external source (urn:alert:source:external)\
       Transitions:\

       *  Each state is labeled by a set of symbols that describe the\
          information that has been extracted from the URNs so far.\
\
       *  Each state has a signal that is a semantic superset of the\
          state's label, i.e., the signal's expressed URNs match the\
          initial portion of the label symbols.  If Alert-Info\
          processing finishes with the FSM in a state, the UA will\
          render the state's signal to the user.\
\
       *  The state's label is marked to show what subset of the symbols\
          are expressed by the state's signal.  Two states can have the\
          same label but different signals.\
\
       *  If a transition's input symbol is compatible with (is a\
          semantic subset of) the current state's label for that\
          category, the next state's label is updated with the input\
          symbol.  If not, the next state is the current state.  This is\
          how the state's label records what information has been\
          accumulated while processing the Alert-Info URNs.\
\
       *  A transition's next state has a signal that semantically\
          subsets the current state's signal as much as possible in the\
          category of the input symbol.  (In most cases, the choice of\
          signal is unique.  In rare cases, there may be more than one\
          signal that meets this criterion, so the designer may have\
          some flexibility.)\

\
4.5.  Examples of Processing Alert-Info URNs\
\
   In the trivial case where the UA receives no Alert-Info URNs,\
   processing begins and ends with the FSM in the initial state, and the\
   default signal is selected.\
\
   If the UA receives\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:source:internal>\
\
   then processing progresses:\
\
       State: Source\
           Process: Source:Internal (urn:alert:source:internal)\
       State: Source:Internal\
       Signal: internal source\
\
   If the UA receives\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:source:external>,\
           <urn:alert:source:internal>\
\
   then processing progresses:\
\
       State: Source\
           Process: Source:External (urn:alert:source:external)\
       State: Source:External\
           Process: Source:Internal (urn:alert:source:internal)\
       State: Source:External\
       Signal: external source\
\
   If the UA receives\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:source:unclassified>,\
           <urn:alert:source:internal>\
\
   then processing progresses:\
\
       State: Source\
           Process: Source:Other (urn:alert:source:unclassified)\
       State: Source:(Other)\
           Process: Source:Internal (urn:alert:source:internal)\
       State: Source:(Other)\
       Signal: default\

\
\
   If the UA receives\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:priority:high>,\
           <urn:alert:source:internal>\
\
   then processing progresses:\
\
       State: Source\
           Ignore: urn:alert:priority:high\
       State: Source\
           Process: Source:Internal (urn:alert:source:internal)\
       State: Source:Internal\
       Signal: internal source\
\
5.  Further Examples\
\
5.1.  Example with "source" and "priority" URNs\
\
   Now consider an example where the UA can signal "external source",\
   "internal source", "low priority", and "high priority" individually\
   or in any combination of source and priority, along with a default\
   signal.  This example is essentially the Cartesian product of two\
   copies of the example in Section 4: one dealing with the call's\
   source and one dealing with the call's priority.  So there are a\
   total of 9 signals:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    -------------------------------\
       default                         (none)\
       external source                 urn:alert:source:external\
       internal source                 urn:alert:source:internal\
       low priority                    urn:alert:priority:low\
       low priority/external source    urn:alert:priority:low,\
                                           urn:alert:source:external\
       low priority/internal source    urn:alert:priority:low,\
                                           urn:alert:source:internal\
       high priority                   urn:alert:priority:high\
       high priority/external source   urn:alert:priority:high,\
                                           urn:alert:source:external\
       high priority/internal source   urn:alert:priority:high,\
                                           urn:alert:source:internal\
\
   The expressed URNs are:\
\
       urn:alert:source:external\
       urn:alert:source:internal\
       urn:alert:priority:low\
       urn:alert:priority:high\

\
   An example of processing that involves multiple "source" URNs and one\
   "priority" URN:\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:source:internal>,\
           <urn:alert:source:unclassified>,\
           <urn:alert:priority:high>\
\
   in which case processing progresses:\
\
       State: Source/Priority\
           Process: Source:Internal (urn:alert:source:internal)\
       State: Source:Internal/Priority\
           Process: Source:(Other) (urn:alert:source:unclassified)\

       State: Source:Internal/Priority:High\
       Signal: internal source/high priority\
\
5.2.  Example 1 of RFC 7462\
\
   A more complicated example is provided in Section 12.2.1 of\
   [RFC7462].  It is like the example in Section 5.1 of this document,\
   except that the UA can only signal "external source", "internal\
   source", "low priority", and "high priority" individually but not in\
   combination, as well as a default signal:\
\
       Signal                          URN(s)\
       ----------------------------    -------------------------------\
       default                         (none)\
       internal source                 urn:alert:source:external\
       external source                 urn:alert:source:internal\
       low priority                    urn:alert:priority:low\
       high priority                   urn:alert:priority:high\
\
   The signals can express the following URNs:\
\
       urn:alert:source:external\
       urn:alert:source:internal\
       urn:alert:priority:low\
       urn:alert:priority:high\
\
   The relevant categories of "alert" URNs are:\
\
       source\
       priority\
\
\
\

       Priority\
       Priority:Low\
       Priority:High\
       Priority:Other\
\
   In this example, the FSM has 20 states because both "source" and\
   "priority" URNs are recorded, but the order in which the two appear\
   affects the signal:\
\
       State: Priority/Source\
       Signal: default\
       Transitions:\
           Priority:Other -> Priority:(Other)/Source\
           Priority:High -> Priority:High/Source\
           Priority:Low -> Priority:Low/Source\
           Source:Other -> Priority/Source:(Other)\
           Source:External -> Priority/Source:External\
           Source:Internal -> Priority/Source:Internal\
\
   State Priority:(Other)/Source can transition to states that can\
   signal the source, because the recorded priority can't be signaled\
   and thus does not block the signaling of the source:\
\
       State: Priority:(Other)/Source\
       Signal: default\
       Transitions:\
           Priority:Other -> Priority:(Other)/Source\

   From the state Priority:High/Source, "source" URNs transition to\
   states that record both source and priority but signal only priority,\
   one of which is Priority:High/Source:(External).  But from\
   Priority/Source:External, the symbol Priority:High transitions to the\
   state Priority:(High)/Source:External, which records the same\
   information but signals the source, not the priority.  One state is\
   reached by processing a "priority" URN and then a "source" URN,\
   whereas the other is reached by processing a "source" URN and then a\
   "priority" URN.\

   A more complicated example involves multiple "source" URNs that do\
   not select a non-default signal and one "priority" URN that can be\
   signaled:\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:source:unclassified>,\
           <urn:alert:source:internal>,\
           <urn:alert:priority:high>\

           Process: Source:Other (urn:alert:source:unclassified)\

           Process: Source:Internal (urn:alert:source:internal)\

           Process: Priority:High (urn:alert:priority:high)\
       State: Priority:High/Source:(Other)\
       Signal: high priority\
\
   The only output of the FSM is the state's signal.  Based on this,\
   several groups of states in this FSM can be merged using standard FSM\
   optimization algorithms:\
\
       states with signal "high priority":\
           Priority:High/Source\
           Priority:High/Source:(Other)\

   This reduces the FSM to eight states:\
\
       Priority/Source\
       Priority:(Other)/Source\
       Priority:(Other)/Source:(Other)\
       Priority:High/Source  [aggregated]\
       Priority:Low/Source  [aggregated]\
       Priority/Source:(Other)\
       Priority/Source:External  [aggregated]\
       Priority/Source:Internal  [aggregated]\
\
5.3.  Examples 2, 3, and 4 of RFC 7462\
\
   Examples 2, 3, and 4 of [RFC7462] are similar to the example in\
   Section 5.1 of this document, but they do not include a signal for\
   the combination "internal source, low priority" to make resolution\
   examples work asymmetrically.\
\
   The FSM for this example has the same alphabet as the FSM of\
   Section 5.1.  Most of the states of this FSM are the same as the\
   states of the FSM of Section 5.1, but the state\
   Source:Internal/Priority:Low is missing because there is no signal\
   for that combination.  It is replaced by two states:\
\
   1.  One state is Source:Internal/Priority:(Low); it records that\
       Source:Internal was specified first (and is to be signaled) and\
       that Priority:Low was specified later (and cannot be signaled --\
       but it still prevents any further "priority" URNs from having an\
       effect).\
\
   2.  The other state is Source:(Internal)/Priority:Low; it records the\
       reverse sequence of events.\
\
   The changes in the FSM are:\
\
       State: Priority:Low/Source\
       Signal: low priority\
       Transitions:\
           Source:Internal -> Priority:Low/Source:(Internal)\
           (other transitions unchanged)\
\
       State: Priority:Low/Source:(Internal)\
       Signal: low priority\
       Transitions:\
           any -> Priority:Low/Source:(Internal)\

   Suppose the same UA receives\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:source:internal>,\
           <urn:alert:priority:low>\
\
   Note that there is no signal that corresponds to this combination.\
   In that case, the processing is:\
\
       State: Priority/Source\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   Notice that the existence of the new states prevents later URNs of a\
   category from overriding earlier URNs of that category, even if the\
   earlier one was not itself signalable and the later one would be\
   signalable in the absence of the earlier one:\
\
       Alert-Info: <urn:alert:priority:low>,\
           <urn:alert:source:internal>,\
           <urn:alert:source:external>\
\
       State: Priority/Source\
           Process: Priority:Low (urn:alert:priority:low)\
       State: Priority:Low/Source\
           Process: Source:Internal (urn:alert:source:internal)\
       State: Priority:Low/Source:(Internal)\
           Process: Source:External (urn:alert:source:external)\
       State: Priority:Low/Source:(Internal)\
       Signal: low priority\
\
   This situation shows the necessity of states whose labels contain\
   parentheses.  If the second transition had been to the state\
   Priority:Low/Source (on the basis that there is no proper state\
   Priority:Low/Source:Internal), then the third transition would have\
   been to the state Priority:Low/Source:External, and the signal would\
   have been "external source/low priority".\
\
5.4.  An Example That Subsets Internal Sources\
\
   In the example of Section 4, there are signals for "external source"\
   and "internal source".  Let us add to that example a signal for\
   "source internal from a VIP (Very Important Person)".  That last\
   signal expresses the private extension URN\
   urn:alert:source:internal:vip@example, which is a subset of\
   urn:alert:source:internal, which is expressed by the "source\
   internal" signal.  There are a total of three expressed URNs, one of\
   which is a subset of another:\
\
       urn:alert:source:internal\
       urn:alert:source:internal:vip@example\
       urn:alert:source:external\
\
   This generates the following alphabet of symbols, which includes two\
   "Other" symbols for the "source" category:\
\
       Source\
       Source:Internal\
       Source:Internal:Vip@example\
       Source:Internal:Other\
       Source:Other\

\
\
5.5.  An Example of "alert:service" URNs\
\
   In this example, there are signals for "service forward" (the call\
   has been forwarded) and "source recall callback" (a recall due to a\
   callback).  This gives two expressed URNs:\
\
       urn:alert:service:forward\
       urn:alert:service:recall:callback\
\
   This generates the following alphabet of symbols.  Note that there\
   are two "Other" symbols, because the "alert:service" URNs have an\
   additional level of qualification.\
\
       Service\
       Service:Forward\
       Service:Recall\
       Service:Recall:Callback\
       Service:Recall:Other\
       Service:Other\
\
5.6.  An Example Using Country Codes\
\
   In this example, we consider how a UA generates ringback signals when\
   the UA wishes to reproduce the traditional behavior where the caller\
   hears the ringback signals defined by the telephone service in the\
   callee's country rather than the ringback signals defined by the\
   service in the caller's country.  In the Alert-Info header field of\
   the 180 (Ringing) provisional response, we assume that the called UA\
   provides an "alert:country" URN [RFC7462] containing the ISO 3166-1\
   [ISO-3166-1] alpha-2 country code of the callee's country.\
\
   The UA has a default signal and a "non-country" signal for\
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting.  For the example country with code\
   "XA", the UA has a default signal and signals for\
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting and urn:alert:service:forward.  For\
   the example country with code "XB", the UA has a default signal and a\
   signal for urn:alert:service:forward.  These inconsistencies between\
   the non-country signals and the country signals are chosen to\
   demonstrate the flexibility of the construction method, showing that\
   three systems of signals can be combined correctly even when the\
   systems were established without coordination between them.\

\
   Call-waiting can be signaled in conjunction with country XA but not\
   in conjunction with country XB, as the UA does not have a signal to\
   present call-waiting alerts for country XB.  Thus, the ordering of\
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting with urn:alert:country:xa does not\
   matter, but if urn:alert:country:xb appears before\
   urn:alert:service:call-waiting, call-waiting cannot be signaled.\

6.  Prioritizing Signals\
\
   The specifications provided in [RFC7462] are oriented toward giving\
   the sender of Alert-Info control over which of the "alert" URNs are\
   most important.  But in some situations, the UA may prefer to\
   prioritize expressing one URN category over another regardless of the\
   order in which their URNs appear in Alert-Info.  This section\
   describes how that can be accommodated within the framework of\
   [RFC7462] and presents an example FSM resulting from that approach.\
\
   This example uses the signals of Section 5.2, viz., "external\
   source", "internal source", "low priority", and "high priority", but\
   this time, we want to signal "high priority" in preference to any\
   other signal that might be applicable.\
\
   We accommodate this within the framework of [RFC7462] by assigning\
   the signal "high priority" for each of these combinations of URNs:\
\
       urn:alert:priority:high\
       urn:alert:priority:high, urn:alert:source:internal\
       urn:alert:priority:high, urn:alert:source:external\
\
   The result is that the signal "high priority" is the "best" signal\
   for any combination of urn:alert:priority:high with "source" URNs.\
\
   Constructing the symbols produces the same results as before.  The\
   signals can express the following URNs:\
\
       urn:alert:source:external\
       urn:alert:source:internal\
       urn:alert:priority:low\
       urn:alert:priority:high\
\
   The relevant categories of "alert" URNs are:\
\
       source\
       priority\
\
   The alphabet of symbols is:\
\
       Source\
       Source:External\
       Source:Internal\
       Source:Other\
       Priority\
       Priority:Low\
       Priority:High\
       Priority:Other\
\
\

Worley                        Informational                    [Page 40]\
\
RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   When the FSM is constructed, it is the same as the FSM of\
   Section 5.2, except that certain states are effectively renamed and\
   merged, because any "source" is defined to be expressed if high\
   priority is expressed:\
\
       Priority:(High)/Source:External and\
       Priority:High/Source:(External) become:\
\
           State: Priority:High/Source:External\
           Signal: high priority\
\
       Priority:(High)/Source:Internal and\
       Priority:High/Source:(Internal) become:\
\
           State: Priority:High/Source:Internal\
           Signal: high priority\
\
   This reduces the FSM to 18 states.  In addition, these two new\
   states, along with a number of other states, can be merged by FSM\
   optimization, since all of them have the signal "high priority" and\
   from them, there are no transitions to states outside this set.  The\
   optimized FSM has 10 states.\
\
7.  Dynamic Sets of Signals\
\
   This section discusses how to construct FSMs for a UA that allows\
   variable sets of signals -- for example, if the user can configure\
   the use of ring tones.  Several approaches can be used:\
\
   o  Whenever the set of ring tones is changed, re-execute the\
      processes of Section 4.\
\
   o  Whenever the set of ring tones is changed, rebuild the list of\
      expressed URNs (Section 4.1) and reconstruct the alphabet of\
      symbols (Section 4.2).  Then, use an algorithm for dynamically\
      constructing the states of the FSM as needed during Alert-Info\
      processing.\
\
   o  If the sets of possible URNs expressed by the ring tones are\
      sufficiently limited, the steps of Section 4 can be carried out\
      "generically", and the generic FSM can be specialized for the\
      current ring tone configuration.\
\
   The remainder of this section gives an example of the third approach.\
\
\
\
\

RFC 8433                Resolving Alert-Info URNs            August 2018\
\
\
   For the example, we will use a set of ring tones that express the\
   identity of the caller.  To signal this information, a private\
   extension "alert" URN category, "caller@example", is used:\
\
       urn:alert:caller@example:alice@example.com\
       urn:alert:caller@example:bob@example.com\
       etc.\
\
   which we can express by the generic pattern\
\
       urn:alert:caller@example:IDENTITY\
\
   where "IDENTITY" is replaced in succession by the set of caller\
   identities that have their own ring tones to generate the set of\
   expressed URNs.\
\
   The alphabet is then:\
\
       Caller@example\
       Caller@example:IDENTITY\
       Caller@example:Other\
\
   where "IDENTITY" is replaced in succession by the set of caller\
   identities.  The "Caller@example:Other" symbol includes all URNs of\
   the category "caller@example" that are not included in any of the\
   "Caller@example:IDENTITY" symbols, i.e, where the second\
   alert-ind-part is not one of the known caller identities.\
\
   The states and transitions of the FSM are:\
\
       State: Caller@example (initial state)\
       Signal: default\
       Transitions:\
           Caller@example:IDENTITY -> Caller@example:IDENTITY\
           Caller@example:Other -> Caller@example:(Other)\
\
       State: Caller@example:IDENTITY\
       Signal: signal for caller IDENTITY\
       Transitions:\
           any -> Caller@example:IDENTITY\
\
       State: Caller@example:(Other)\
       Signal: default\
       Transitions:\
           any -> Caller@example:(Other)\

\
\
   where again, the second state is replicated once for each caller\
   identity that has a ring tone, with "IDENTITY" replaced with the\
   caller identity.\
\
8.  Security Considerations\
\
   The security considerations discussed in Section 16 of [RFC7462]\
   regarding the use and processing of "alert" URNs MUST be followed\
   when the algorithm described in this document is used.\
\
   Like any implementation of [RFC7462], implementations of the\
   algorithm defined in this document MUST take into account that the\
   value of a received Alert-Info header field may contain URIs of any\
   scheme, may contain syntactically invalid values, and may be\
   syntactically invalid overall.  The handling of syntactically invalid\
   values is specified by [RFC3261].  The handling of URIs other than\
   "alert" URIs is outside the scope of this document (and outside the\
   scope of [RFC7462]) and MAY be subject to local policy.\
\
   Like the algorithm described in Section 12 of [RFC7462], the output\
   of the algorithm defined in this document is limited to a choice\
   among the signals that it has been configured for, limiting the\
   security issues regarding the processing of its output.  This\
   algorithm will use at most linear time and constant space to process\
   a sequence of "alert" URNs.  This is significantly more efficient\
   than the algorithm of [RFC7462] and minimizes the security\
   vulnerabilities of this processing step that are due to resource\
   consumption.\
\
   However, the process defined in this document for constructing an FSM\
   can use more than linear time and constant space -- probably\
   exponential time and space in the worst case.  This SHOULD be taken\
   into consideration whenever an FSM is constructed using this\
   algorithm and MUST be taken into consideration when it is done\
   dynamically by a UA.  Whenever an FSM is constructed by a process\
   that is not under the direct supervision of a human user, procedures\
   MUST be used to ensure that (1) the processing and memory consumption\
   are limited to acceptable amounts and (2) if the FSM construction is\
   aborted due to excessive consumption, the designated consumers of the\
   FSM MUST have appropriate fallback procedures.\
\
9.  IANA Considerations\
\
   This document has no IANA actions.\

               A Framework for Management and Control of\
           Microwave and Millimeter Wave Interface Parameters\
\
Abstract\
\
   The unification of control and management of microwave radio link\
   interfaces is a precondition for seamless multi-layer networking and\
   automated network provisioning and operation.\
\
   This document describes the required characteristics and use cases\
   for control and management of radio link interface parameters using a\
   YANG data model.\
\
   The purpose is to create a framework to identify the necessary\
   information elements and define a YANG data model for control and\
   management of the radio link interfaces in a microwave node.  Some\
   parts of the resulting model may be generic and could also be used by\
   other technologies, e.g., Ethernet technology.\

RFC 8432                   Microwave Framework              October 2018\
\
\
1.  Introduction\
\
   Microwave radio is a technology that uses high-frequency radio waves\
   to provide high-speed wireless connections that can send and receive\
   voice, video, and data information.  It is a general term used for\
   systems covering a very large range of traffic capacities, channel\
   separations, modulation formats, and applications over a wide range\
   of frequency bands from 1.4 GHz up to and above 100 GHz.\
\
   The main application for microwave is backhaul for mobile broadband.\
   Those networks will continue to be modernized using a combination of\
   microwave and fiber technologies.  The choice of technology depends\
   on fiber presence and cost of ownership, not capacity limitations in\
   microwave.\
\
   Today, microwave is already able to fully support the capacity needs\
   of a backhaul in a radio access network and will evolve to support\
   multiple gigabits in traditional frequency bands and more than 10\
   gigabits in higher-frequency bands with more bandwidth.  Layer 2 (L2)\
   Ethernet features are normally an integrated part of microwave nodes,\
   and more advanced L2 and Layer 3 (L3) features will be introduced\
   over time to support the evolution of the transport services that\
   will be provided by a backhaul/transport network.  Note that wireless\
   access technologies such as 3/4/5G and Wi-Fi are not within the scope\
   of this document.\
\
   Open and standardized interfaces are a prerequisite for efficient\
   management of equipment from multiple vendors, integrated in a single\
   system/controller.  This framework addresses management and control\
   of the radio link interface(s) and their relationship to other\
   interfaces (typically, Ethernet interfaces) in a microwave node.  A\
   radio link provides the transport over the air, using one or several\
   carriers in aggregated or protected configurations.  Managing and\
   controlling a transport service over a microwave node involves both\
   radio link and packet transport functionality.\
\
   Today, there are already numerous IETF data models, RFCs, and\
   Internet-Drafts with technology-specific extensions that cover a\
   large part of the L2 and L3 domains.  Examples include IP Management\
   [RFC8344], Routing Management [RFC8349], and Provider Bridge\
   [IEEE802.1Qcp].  These are based on the IETF YANG data model for\
   Interface Management [RFC8343], which is an evolution of the SNMP\
   IF-MIB [RFC2863].\
\
   Since microwave nodes will contain more and more L2 and L3 (packet)\
   functionality that is expected to be managed using those models,\
   there are advantages if radio link interfaces can be modeled and\
   managed using the same structure and the same approach.  This is\
\
\
\
Ahlberg, et al.               Informational                     [Page 3]\

\
\
   especially true for use cases in which a microwave node is managed as\
   one common entity that includes both the radio link and the L2 and L3\
   functionality, e.g., basic configuration of the node and connections,\
   centralized troubleshooting, upgrade, and maintenance.  All\
   interfaces in a node, irrespective of technology, would then be\
   accessed from the same core model, i.e., [RFC8343], and could be\
   extended with technology-specific parameters in models augmenting\
   that core model.  The relationship/connectivity between interfaces\
   could be given by the physical equipment configuration.  For example,\
   the slot where the Radio Link Terminal (modem) is plugged in could be\
   associated with a specific Ethernet port due to the wiring in the\
   backplane of the system, or it could be flexible and therefore\
   configured via a management system or controller.\

\
   There will always be certain implementations that differ among\
   products, so it is practically impossible to achieve industry\
   consensus on every design detail.  It is therefore important to focus\
   on the parameters that are required to support the use cases\
   applicable for centralized, unified, multi-vendor management and to\
   allow other parameters to either be optional or be covered by\
   extensions to the standardized model.  Furthermore, a standard that\
   allows for a certain degree of freedom encourages innovation and\
   competition, which benefits the entire industry.  Thus, it is\
   important that a radio link management model covers all relevant\
   functions but also leaves room for product- and feature-specific\
   extensions.\
\
   Models are available for microwave radio link functionality:\

   Radio Link YANG Data Models" submitted to and discussed by the CCAMP\
   Working Group [CCAMP-MW].  The purpose of this document is to reach\

   characteristics of the model.  It also includes an analysis of how\
   the models in the two ongoing initiatives fulfill these expectations\

\
2.  Terminology and Definitions\
\
   Microwave radio:  a term commonly used for technologies that operate\
      in both microwave and millimeter wavelengths and in frequency\
      bands from 1.4 GHz up to and beyond 100 GHz.  In traditional\
      bands, it typically supports capacities of 1-3 Gbps; in the 70/80\
      GHz band, it supports up to 10 Gbps.  Using multi-carrier systems\
      operating in frequency bands with wider channels, the technology\
      will be capable of providing capacities of up to 100 Gbps.\
\
   Microwave radio technology:  widely used for point-to-point\
      telecommunications because its small wavelength allows\
      conveniently sized antennas to direct radio waves in narrow beams\
      and its comparatively higher frequencies allow broad bandwidth and\
      high data-transmission rates.  It is used for a broad range of\
      fixed and mobile services, including high-speed, point-to-point\
      wireless local area networks (WLANs) and broadband access.\
\
      The ETSI EN 302 217 series defines the characteristics and\
      requirements of microwave equipment and antennas.  In particular,\
      ETSI EN 302 217-2 [EN302217-2] specifies the essential parameters\
      for the systems operating from 1.4 GHz to 86 GHz.\
\
   Carrier Termination and Radio Link Terminal:  two concepts defined to\
      support modeling of microwave radio link features and parameters\
      in a structured yet simple manner.\
\
      *  Carrier Termination: an interface for the capacity provided\
         over the air by a single carrier.  It is typically defined by\
         its transmitting and receiving frequencies.\

\
\
      *  Radio Link Terminal: an interface providing Ethernet capacity\
         and/or Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) capacity to the\
         associated Ethernet and/or TDM interfaces in a node.  It is\
         used for setting up a transport service over a microwave radio\
         link.\

      Termination and Radio Link Terminal concepts.\

   Software-Defined Networking (SDN):  an architecture that decouples\
      the network control and forwarding functions, enabling the network\
      control to become directly programmable and the underlying\
      infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network\
      services.  SDN can be used for automation of traditional network\
      management functionality using an SDN approach of standardized\
      programmable interfaces for control and management [RFC7426].\

3.  Approaches to Manage and Control Radio Link Interfaces\
\
   This framework addresses the definition of an open and standardized\
   interface for radio link functionality in a microwave node.  The\
   application of such an interface used for management and control of\
   nodes and networks typically varies from one operator to another in\
   terms of the systems used and how they interact.  Possible approaches\
   include using a Network Management System (NMS), Software-Defined\
   Networking (SDN), or some combination of the two.  As there are still\
   many networks where the NMS is implemented as one component/interface\
   and the SDN controller is scoped to control-plane functionality as a\
   separate component/interface, this document does not preclude either\
   model.  The aim of this document is to provide a framework for\
   development of a common YANG data model for both management and\
   control of microwave interfaces.\
\
3.1.  Network Management Solutions\
\
   The classic network management solutions, with vendor-specific domain\
   management combined with cross-domain functionality for service\
   management and analytics, still dominate the market.  These solutions\
   are expected to evolve and benefit from an increased focus on\
   standardization by simplifying multi-vendor management and removing\
   the need for vendor- or domain-specific management.\
\
3.2.  Software-Defined Networking\
\
   One of the main drivers for applying SDN from an operator perspective\
   is simplification and automation of network provisioning as well as\
   end-to-end network service management.  The vision is to have a\
   global view of the network conditions spanning different vendors'\
   equipment and multiple technologies.\
\
   If nodes from different vendors are managed by the same SDN\
   controller via a node management interface without the extra effort\
   of introducing intermediate systems, all nodes must align their node\
   management interfaces.  Hence, an open and standardized node\
   management interface is required in a multi-vendor environment.  Such\
   a standardized interface enables unified management and configuration\
   of nodes from different vendors by a common set of applications.\
\
   In addition to SDN applications for configuring, managing, and\
   controlling the nodes and their associated transport interfaces\
   (including the L2 Ethernet, L3 IP, and radio interfaces), there are\
   also a large variety of more advanced SDN applications that can be\
   utilized and/or developed.\
\
\
\

RFC 8432                   Microwave Framework              October 2018\
\
\
   A potentially flexible approach for operators is to use SDN in a\
   logically controlled way, managing the radio links by selecting a\
   predefined operation mode.  The operation mode is a set of logical\
   metrics or parameters describing a complete radio link configuration,\
   such as capacity, availability, priority, and power consumption.\
\
   An example of an operation mode table is shown in Figure 3.  Based on\
   its operation policy (e.g., power consumption or traffic priority),\
   the SDN controller selects one operation mode and translates that\
   into the required configuration of the individual parameters for the\
   Radio Link Terminals and the associated Carrier Terminations.\
\
   +----+---------------+------------+-------------+-----------+------+\
   | ID |Description    | Capacity   |Availability | Priority  |Power |\
   +----+---------------+------------+-------------+-----------+------+\
   | 1  |High capacity  |  400 Mbps  |  99.9%      | Low       |High  |\
   +----+---------------+------------+-------------+-----------+------+\
   | 2  |High avail-    |  100 Mbps  |  99.999%    | High      |Low   |\
   |    | ability       |            |             |           |      |\
   +----+---------------+------------+-------------+-----------+------+\
\
               Figure 3: Example of an Operation Mode Table\
\
   An operation mode bundles together the values of a set of different\
   parameters.  How each operation mode maps a certain set of attributes\
   is out of the scope of this document.\
\
4.  Use Cases\
\
   The use cases described should be the basis for identifying and\
   defining the parameters to be supported by a YANG data model for\
   management of radio links that will be applicable to centralized,\
   unified, multi-vendor management.  The use cases involve\
   configuration management, inventory, status and statistics,\
   performance management, fault management, and troubleshooting and\
   root cause analysis.\
\
   Other product-specific use cases, e.g., addressing installation or\
   on-site troubleshooting and fault resolution, are outside the scope\
   of this framework.  If required, these use cases are expected to be\
   supported by product-specific extensions to the standardized model.\

\
4.1.  Configuration Management\
\
   Configuration management involves configuring a Radio Link Terminal,\
   the constituent Carrier Terminations, and, when applicable, the\
   relationship to IP/Ethernet and TDM interfaces.\
\
   o  Understand the capabilities and limitations\
\
      Exchange of information between a manager and a device about the\
      capabilities supported and specific limitations in the parameter\
      values and enumerations that can be used.\
\
      Examples of information that could be exchanged include the\
      maximum modulation supported and support (or lack of support) for\
      the Cross Polarization Interference Cancellation (XPIC) feature.\
\
   o  Initial Configuration\
\
      Initial configuration of a Radio Link Terminal, enough to\
      establish Layer 1 (L1) connectivity to an associated Radio Link\
      Terminal on a device at the far end over the hop.  It may also\
      include configuration of the relationship between a Radio Link\
      Terminal and an associated traffic interface, e.g., an Ethernet\
      interface, unless that is given by the equipment configuration.\
\
      Frequency, modulation, coding, and output power are examples of\
      parameters typically configured for a Carrier Termination and type\
      of aggregation/bonding or protection configurations expected for a\
      Radio Link Terminal.\
\
   o  Radio link reconfiguration and optimization\
\
      Reconfiguration, update, or optimization of an existing Radio Link\
      Terminal.  Output power and modulation for a Carrier Termination\
      as well as protection schemas and activation/deactivation of\
      carriers in a Radio Link Terminal are examples on parameters that\
      can be reconfigured and used for optimization of the performance\
      of a network.\
\
   o  Radio link logical configuration\
\
      Radio Link Terminals configured to include a group of carriers are\
      widely used in microwave technology.  There are several kinds of\
      groups: aggregation/bonding, 1+1 protection/redundancy, etc.  To\
      avoid configuration on each Carrier Termination directly, a\
      logical control provides flexible management by mapping a logical\
      configuration to a set of physical attributes.  This could also be\

\
\
      applied in a hierarchical SDN environment where some domain\
      controllers are located between the SDN controller and the Radio\
      Link Terminal.\
\
4.2.  Inventory\
\
   o  Retrieve logical inventory and configuration from device\
\
      Request from manager and response by device with information about\
      radio interfaces, e.g., their constitution and configuration.\
\
   o  Retrieve physical/equipment inventory from device\
\
      Request from manager about physical and/or equipment inventory\
      associated with the Radio Link Terminals and Carrier Terminations.\
\
4.3.  Status and Statistics\
\
   o  Actual status and performance of a radio link interface\
\
      Manager requests and device responds with information about actual\
      status and statistics of configured radio link interfaces and\
      their constituent parts.  It's important to report the effective\
      bandwidth of a radio link since it can be configured to\
      dynamically adjust the modulation based on the current signal\
      conditions.\
\
4.4.  Performance Management\
\
   o  Configuration of historical performance measurements\
\
      Configuration of historical performance measurements for a radio\
      link interface and/or its constituent parts.  See Section 4.1.\
\
   o  Collection of historical performance data\
\
      Collection of historical performance data in bulk by the manager\
      is a general use case for a device and not specific to a radio\
      link interface.\
\
      Collection of an individual counter for a specific interval is in\
      some cases required as a complement to the retrieval in bulk as\
      described above.\

\
4.5.  Fault Management\
\
   o  Configuration of alarm reporting\
\
      Configuration of alarm reporting associated specifically with\
      radio interfaces, e.g., configuration of alarm severity, is a\
      subset of the configuration use case to be supported.  See\
      Section 4.1.\
\
   o  Alarm management\
\
      Alarm synchronization, visualization, handling, notifications, and\
      events are generic use cases for a device and should be supported\
      on a radio link interface.  There are, however, radio-specific\
      alarms that are important to report.  Signal degradation of the\
      radio link is one example.\
\
4.6.  Troubleshooting and Root Cause Analysis\
\
   Provide information and suggest actions required by a manager/\
   operator to investigate and understand the underlying issue to a\
   problem in the performance and/or functionality of a Radio Link\
   Terminal and the associated Carrier Terminations.\
\
5.  Requirements\
\
   For managing a microwave node including both the radio link and the\
   packet transport functionality, a unified data model is desired to\
   unify the modeling of the radio link interfaces and the L2/L3\
   interfaces using the same structure and the same modeling approach.\
   If some part of the model is generic for other technology usage, it\
   should be clearly stated.\
\
   The purpose of the YANG data model is for management and control of\
   the radio link interface(s) and the relationship/connectivity to\
   other interfaces, typically to Ethernet interfaces, in a microwave\
   node.\
\
   The capability of configuring and managing microwave nodes includes\
   the following requirements for the model:\
\
   1.  It MUST be possible to configure, manage, and control a Radio\
       Link Terminal and the constituent Carrier Terminations.\
\
       A.  Configuration of frequency, channel bandwidth, modulation,\
           coding, and transmitter output power MUST be supported for a\
           Carrier Termination.\
\

RFC 8432                   Microwave Framework              October 2018\
\
\
       B.  A Radio Link Terminal MUST configure the associated Carrier\
           Terminations and the type of aggregation/bonding or\
           protection configurations expected for the Radio Link\
           Terminal.\
\
       C.  The capability (e.g., the maximum modulation supported) and\
           the actual status/statistics (e.g., administrative status of\
           the carriers) SHOULD also be supported by the data model.\
\
       D.  The definition of the features and parameters SHOULD be based\
           on established microwave equipment and radio standards, such\
           as ETSI EN 302 217 [EN302217-2], which specifies the\
           essential parameters for microwave systems operating from 1.4\
           GHz to 86 GHz.\
\
   2.  It MUST be possible to map different traffic types (e.g., TDM and\
       Ethernet) to the transport capacity provided by a specific Radio\
       Link Terminal.\
\
   3.  It MUST be possible to configure and collect historical\
       measurements (for the use case described in Section 4.4) to be\
       performed on a radio link interface (e.g., minimum, maximum,\
       average transmit power, and received level in dBm).\
\
   4.  It MUST be possible to configure and retrieve alarms reporting\
       associated with the radio interfaces (e.g., configuration fault,\
       signal lost, modem fault, and radio fault).\
\
6.  Gap Analysis on Models\
\
   The purpose of the gap analysis is to identify and recommend what\
   models to use in a microwave device to support the use cases and\
   requirements specified in the previous sections.  This document also\
   makes a recommendation for how the gaps not supported should be\
   filled, including the need for development of new models and\
   evolution of existing models and documents.\
\
   Models are available for microwave radio link functionality:\
   "Microwave Information Model" by the ONF [ONF-MW] and "Microwave\
   Radio Link YANG Data Models" submitted to and discussed by the CCAMP\
   Working Group [CCAMP-MW].  The analysis in this document takes these\
   initiatives into consideration and makes a recommendation on how to\
   use and complement them in order to fill the gaps identified.\
\
   For generic functionality, not functionality specific to radio link,\
   the ambition is to refer to existing or emerging models that could be\
   applicable for all functional areas in a microwave node.\

\
\
6.1.  Microwave Radio Link Functionality\
\
   [ONF-CIM] defines a CoreModel of the ONF Common Information Model.\
   An information model describes the things in a domain in terms of\
   objects, their properties (represented as attributes), and their\
   relationships.  The ONF information model is expressed in Unified\
   Modeling Language (UML).  The ONF CoreModel is independent of\
   specific data-plane technology.  The technology-specific content,\
   acquired in a runtime solution via "filled in" cases of\
   specification, augments the CoreModel by providing a forwarding\
   technology-specific representation.\
\
   IETF data models define implementations and protocol-specific\
   details.  YANG is a data modeling language used to model the\
   configuration and state data.  [RFC8343] defines a generic YANG data\
   model for interface management that doesn't include technology-\
   specific information.  To describe the technology-specific\
   information, several YANG data models have been proposed in the IETF\
   to augment [RFC8343], e.g., the data model defined in [RFC8344].  The\
   YANG data model is a popular approach for modeling interfaces for\
   many packet transport technologies and is thereby well positioned to\
   become an industry standard.  In light of this trend, [CCAMP-MW]\
   provides a YANG data model proposal for radio interfaces that is well\
   aligned with the structure of other technology-specific YANG data\
   models augmenting [RFC8343].\
\
   [RFC3444] explains the difference between Information Models (IMs)\
   and Data Models (DMs).  An IM models managed objects at a conceptual\
   level for designers and operators, while a DM is defined at a lower\
   level and includes many details for implementers.  In addition, the\
   protocol-specific details are usually included in a DM.  Since\
   conceptual models can be implemented in different ways, multiple DMs\
   can be derived from a single IM.\
\
   It is recommended to use the structure of the model described in\
   [CCAMP-MW] as the starting point, since it is a data model providing\
   the wanted alignment with [RFC8343].  To cover the identified gaps,\
   it is recommended to define new leafs/parameters and include those in\
   the new model [IETF-MW] while taking reference from [ONF-CIM].  It is\
   also recommended to add the required data nodes to describe the\
   interface layering for the capacity provided by a Radio Link Terminal\
   and the associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces in a microwave node.\
   The principles and data nodes for interface layering described in\
   [RFC8343] should be used as a basis.\

\
6.2.  Generic Functionality\
\
   For generic functionality, not functionality specific to radio links,\
   the recommendation is to refer to existing RFCs or emerging Internet-\
   Drafts according to Figure 4.  "[IETF-MW]" is used in Figure 4 for\
   the cases where the functionality is recommended to be included in\
   the new model [IETF-MW] as described in Section 6.1.\

\
     Figure 4: Recommendation for How to Support Generic Functionality\
\
   Microwave-specific alarm configurations are recommended to be\
   included in the new model [IETF-MW] and could be based on what is\
   supported in the models described in [ONF-MW] and [CCAMP-MW].  Alarm\
   notifications and synchronization are general and are recommended to\
   be supported by a generic model, such as [YANG-ALARM].\
\
   Activation of interval counters and thresholds could be a generic\
   function, but it is recommended to be supported by the new model\
   [IETF-MW].  It can be based on the models described in [ONF-MW] and\
   [CCAMP-MW].\
\
   Collection of interval/historical counters is a generic function that\
   needs to be supported in a node.  File-based collection via the SSH\
   File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and collection via NETCONF/YANG\
   interfaces are two possible options; the recommendation is to include\

RFC 8432                   Microwave Framework              October 2018\
\
\
   support for the latter in the new model [IETF-MW].  The models\
   described in [ONF-MW] and [CCAMP-MW] can also be used as a basis in\
   this area.\
\
   Physical and/or equipment inventory associated with the Radio Link\
   Terminals and Carrier Terminations is recommended to be covered by a\
   generic model for the complete node, e.g., the model defined in\
   [RFC8348].  It is thereby outside the scope of the new model\
   [IETF-MW].\
\
6.3.  Summary\
\
   The conclusions and recommendations from the analysis can be\
   summarized as follows:\
\
   1.  A new YANG data model for radio link [IETF-MW] should be defined\
       with enough scope to support the use cases and requirements in\
       Sections 4 and 5 of this document.\
\
   2.  Use the structure of the model described in [CCAMP-MW] as the\
       starting point.  It augments [RFC8343] and is thereby as required\
       aligned with the structure of the models for management of the L2\
       and L3 domains.\
\
   3.  Use established microwave equipment and radio standards (such as\
       [EN302217-2], the model described in [CCAMP-MW], and the model\
       described in [ONF-MW]) as the basis for the definition of the\
       detailed leafs/ parameters to support the specified use cases and\
       requirements, proposing new ones to cover identified gaps.\
\
   4.  Add the required data nodes to describe the interface layering\
       for the capacity provided by a Radio Link Terminal and the\
       associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces, using the principles and\
       data nodes for interface layering described in [RFC8343] as a\
       basis.\
\
   5.  Include support for configuration of microwave-specific alarms in\
       the new YANG data model [IETF-MW] and rely on a generic model\
       such as [YANG-ALARM] for notifications and alarm synchronization.\
\
   6.  Use a generic model such as [RFC8348] for physical/equipment\
       inventory.\

\
\
7.  Security Considerations\
\
   The configuration information may be considered sensitive or\
   vulnerable in network environments.  Unauthorized access to\
   configuration data nodes can have a negative effect on network\
   operations, e.g., interrupting the ability to forward traffic or\
   increasing the interference level of the network.  The status and\
   inventory reveal some network information that could be very helpful\
   to an attacker.  A malicious attack to that information may result in\
   a loss of customer data.  Security issues concerning the access\
   control to management interfaces can be generally addressed by\
   authentication techniques providing origin verification, integrity,\
   and confidentiality.  In addition, management interfaces can be\
   physically or logically isolated by configuring them to be only\
   accessible out-of-band, through a system that is physically or\
   logically separated from the rest of the network infrastructure.  In\
   cases where management interfaces are accessible in-band at the\
   client device or within the microwave transport network domain,\
   filtering or firewalling techniques can be used to restrict\
   unauthorized in-band traffic.  Additionally, authentication\
   techniques may be used in all cases.\
\
   This framework describes the requirements and characteristics of a\
   YANG data model for control and management of the radio link\
   interfaces in a microwave node.  It is supposed to be accessed via a\
   management protocol with a secure transport layer, such as NETCONF\
   [RFC6241].\

           Requirements for Parallel NFS (pNFS) Layout Types\
\
Abstract\
\
   This document defines the requirements that individual Parallel NFS\
   (pNFS) layout types need to meet in order to work within the pNFS\
   framework as defined in RFC 5661.  In so doing, this document aims to\
   clearly distinguish between requirements for pNFS as a whole and\
   those specifically directed to the pNFS file layout.  The lack of a\
   clear separation between the two sets of requirements has been\
   troublesome for those specifying and evaluating new layout types.  In\
   this regard, this document updates RFC 5661.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   The concept of "layout type" has a central role in the definition and\
   implementation of Parallel NFS (pNFS) (see [RFC5661]).  Clients and\
   servers implementing different layout types behave differently in\
   many ways while conforming to the overall pNFS framework defined in\
   [RFC5661] and this document.  Layout types may differ as to:\
\
   o  The method used to do I/O operations directed to data storage\
      devices.\
\
   o  The requirements for communication between the metadata server\
      (MDS) and the storage devices.\
\
   o  The means used to ensure that I/O requests are only processed when\
      the client holds an appropriate layout.\
\
   o  The format and interpretation of nominally opaque data fields in\
      pNFS-related NFSv4.x data structures.\
\
   Each layout type will define the needed details for its usage in the\
   specification for that layout type; layout type specifications are\
   always Standards Track RFCs.  Except for the file layout type defined\
\
\

RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   in Section 13 of [RFC5661], existing layout types are defined in\
   their own Standards Track documents, and it is anticipated that new\
   layout types will be defined in similar documents.\
\
   The file layout type was defined in the Network File System (NFS)\
   version 4.1 protocol specification [RFC5661].  The block layout type\
   was defined in [RFC5663], and the object layout type was defined in\
   [RFC5664].  Subsequently, the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)\
   layout type was defined in [RFC8154].\
\
   Some implementers have interpreted the text in Sections 12 ("Parallel\
   NFS (pNFS)") and 13 ("NFSv4.1 as a Storage Protocol in pNFS: the File\
   Layout Type") of [RFC5661] as applying only to the file layout type.\
   Because Section 13 was not covered in a separate Standards Track\
   document such as those for both the block and object layout types,\
   there was some confusion as to the responsibilities of both the\
   metadata server and the data servers (DSs) that were laid out in\
   Section 12.\
\
   As a consequence, authors of new specifications (see [RFC8435] and\
   [Lustre]) may struggle to meet the requirements to be a pNFS layout\
   type.  This document gathers the requirements from all of the\
   original Standards Track documents regarding layout type and then\
   specifies the requirements placed on all layout types independent of\
   the particular type chosen.\
\
2.  Definitions\
\
   control communication requirement:  the specification for information\
      on layouts, stateids, file metadata, and file data that must be\
      communicated between the metadata server and the storage devices.\
      There is a separate set of requirements for each layout type.\
\
   control protocol:  the particular mechanism that an implementation of\
      a layout type would use to meet the control communication\
      requirement for that layout type.  This need not be a protocol as\
      normally understood.  In some cases, the same protocol may be used\
      as both a control protocol and storage protocol.\
\
   storage protocol:  the protocol used by clients to do I/O operations\
      to the storage device.  Each layout type specifies the set of\
      storage protocols.\
\
   loose coupling:  when the control protocol is a storage protocol.\
\
\
\
\

Haynes                       Standards Track                    [Page 3]\
\
RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   tight coupling:  an arrangement in which the control protocol is one\
      designed specifically for control communication.  It may be either\
      a proprietary protocol adapted specifically to a particular\
      metadata server or a protocol based on a Standards Track document.\
\
   (file) data:  that part of the file system object that contains the\
      data to be read or written.  It is the contents of the object\
      rather than the attributes of the object.\
\
   data server (DS):  a pNFS server that provides the file's data when\
      the file system object is accessed over a file-based protocol.\
      Note that this usage differs from that in [RFC5661], which applies\
      the term in some cases even when other sorts of protocols are\
      being used.  Depending on the layout, there might be one or more\
      data servers over which the data is striped.  While the metadata\
      server is strictly accessed over the NFSv4.1 protocol, the data\
      server could be accessed via any file access protocol that meets\
      the pNFS requirements.\
\
      See Section 2.1 for a comparison of this term and "storage\
      device".\
\
   storage device:  the target to which clients may direct I/O requests\
      when they hold an appropriate layout.  Note that each data server\
      is a storage device but that some storage device are not data\
      servers.  See Section 2.1 for further discussion.\
\
   fencing:  the process by which the metadata server prevents the\
      storage devices from processing I/O from a specific client to a\
      specific file.\
\
   layout:  the information a client uses to access file data on a\
      storage device.  This information includes specification of the\
      protocol (layout type) and the identity of the storage devices to\
      be used.\
\
      The bulk of the contents of the layout are defined in [RFC5661] as\
      nominally opaque, but individual layout types are responsible for\
      specifying the format of the layout data.\
\
   layout iomode:  a grant of either read-only or read/write I/O to the\
      client.\
\
   layout stateid:  a 128-bit quantity returned by a server that\
      uniquely defines the layout state provided by the server for a\
      specific layout that describes a layout type and file (see\
\
\
\

RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
      Section 12.5.2 of [RFC5661]).  Further, Section 12.5.3 of\
      [RFC5661] describes differences in handling between layout\
      stateids and other stateid types.\
\
   layout type:  a specification of both the storage protocol used to\
      access the data and the aggregation scheme used to lay out the\
      file data on the underlying storage devices.\
\
   recalling a layout:  a graceful recall, via a callback, of a specific\
      layout by the metadata server to the client.  Graceful here means\
      that the client would have the opportunity to flush any WRITEs,\
      etc., before returning the layout to the metadata server.\
\
   revoking a layout:  an invalidation of a specific layout by the\
      metadata server.  Once revocation occurs, the metadata server will\
      not accept as valid any reference to the revoked layout, and a\
      storage device will not accept any client access based on the\
      layout.\
\
   (file) metadata:  the part of the file system object that contains\
      various descriptive data relevant to the file object, as opposed\
      to the file data itself.  This could include the time of last\
      modification, access time, EOF position, etc.\
\
   metadata server (MDS):  the pNFS server that provides metadata\
      information for a file system object.  It is also responsible for\
      generating, recalling, and revoking layouts for file system\
      objects, for performing directory operations, and for performing\
      I/O operations to regular files when the clients direct these to\
      the metadata server itself.\
\
   stateid:  a 128-bit quantity returned by a server that uniquely\
      defines the set of locking-related state provided by the server.\
      Stateids may designate state related to open files, byte-range\
      locks, delegations, or layouts.\
\
2.1.  Use of the Terms "Data Server" and "Storage Device"\
\
   In [RFC5661], the terms "data server" and "storage device" are used\
   somewhat inconsistently:\
\
   o  In Section 12, where pNFS in general is discussed, the term\
      "storage device" is used.\
\
   o  In Section 13, where the file layout type is discussed, the term\
      "data server" is used.\
\
\
\
\
\
Haynes                       Standards Track                    [Page 5]\
\
RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   o  In other sections, the term "data server" is used, even in\
      contexts where the storage access type is not NFSv4.1 or any other\
      file access protocol.\
\
   As this document deals with pNFS in general, it uses the more generic\
   term "storage device" in preference to "data server".  The term "data\
   server" is used only in contexts in which a file server is used as a\
   storage device.  Note that every data server is a storage device, but\
   storage devices that use protocols that are not file access protocols\
   (such as NFS) are not data servers.\
\
   Since a given storage device may support multiple layout types, a\
   given device can potentially act as a data server for some set of\
   storage protocols while simultaneously acting as a storage device for\
   others.\
\
2.2.  Requirements Language\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
   This document differs from most Standards Track documents in that it\
   specifies requirements for those defining future layout types rather\
   than defining the requirements for implementations directly.  This\
   document makes clear whether:\
\
   (1)  any particular requirement applies to implementations.\
\
   (2)  any particular requirement applies to those defining layout\
        types.\
\
   (3)  the requirement is a general requirement that implementations\
        need to conform to, with the specific means left to layout type\
        definitions type to specify.\
\
3.  The Control Protocol\
\
   A layout type has to meet the requirements that apply to the\
   interaction between the metadata server and the storage device such\
   that they present to the client a consistent view of stored data and\
   locking state (Section 12.2.6 of [RFC5661]).  Particular\
   implementations may satisfy these requirements in any manner they\
   choose, and the mechanism chosen need not be described as a protocol.\
   Specifications defining layout types need to clearly show how\
   implementations can meet the requirements discussed below, especially\
\
\
\
Haynes                       Standards Track                    [Page 6]\
\
RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   with respect to those that have security implications.  In addition,\
   such specifications may find it necessary to impose requirements on\
   implementations of the layout type to ensure appropriate\
   interoperability.\
\
   In some cases, there may be no control protocol other than the\
   storage protocol.  This is often described as using a "loosely\
   coupled" model.  In such cases, the assumption is that the metadata\
   server, storage devices, and client may be changed independently and\
   that the implementation requirements in the layout type specification\
   need to ensure this degree of interoperability.  This model is used\
   in the block and object layout type specification.\
\
   In other cases, it is assumed that there will be a purpose-built\
   control protocol that may be different for different implementations\
   of the metadata server and data server.  The assumption here is that\
   the metadata server and data servers are designed and implemented as\
   a unit and interoperability needs to be assured between clients and\
   metadata-data server pairs, developed independently.  This is the\
   model used for the file layout.\
\
   Another possibility is for the definition of a control protocol to be\
   specified in a Standards Track document.  There are two subcases to\
   consider:\
\
   o  A new layout type includes a definition of a particular control\
      protocol whose use is obligatory for metadata servers and storage\
      devices implementing the layout type.  In this case, the\
      interoperability model is similar to the first case above, and the\
      defining document should assure interoperability among metadata\
      servers, storage devices, and clients developed independently.\
\
   o  A control protocol is defined in a Standards Track document that\
      meets the control protocol requirements for one of the existing\
      layout types.  In this case, the new document's job is to assure\
      interoperability between metadata servers and storage devices\
      developed separately.  The existing definition document for the\
      selected layout type retains the function of assuring\
      interoperability between clients and a given collection of\
      metadata servers and storage devices.  In this context,\
      implementations that implement the new protocol are treated in the\
      same way as those that use an internal control protocol or a\
      functional equivalent.\
\
   An example of this last case is the SCSI layout type [RFC8154], which\
   extends the block layout type.  The block layout type had a\
   requirement for fencing of clients but did not present a way for the\
\
\
\
\
Haynes                       Standards Track                    [Page 7]\
\
RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   control protocol (in this case, the SCSI storage protocol) to fence\
   the client.  The SCSI layout type remedies that in [RFC8154] and, in\
   effect, has a tightly coupled model.\
\
3.1.  Control Protocol Requirements\
\
   The requirements of interactions between the metadata server and the\
   storage devices are:\
\
   (1)  The metadata server MUST be able to service the client's I/O\
        requests if the client decides to make such requests to the\
        metadata server instead of to the storage device.  The metadata\
        server must be able to retrieve the data from the constituent\
        storage devices and present it back to the client.  A corollary\
        to this is that even though the metadata server has successfully\
        given the client a layout, the client MAY still send I/O\
        requests to the metadata server.\
\
   (2)  The metadata server MUST be able to restrict access to a file on\
        the storage devices when it revokes a layout.  The metadata\
        server typically would revoke a layout whenever a client fails\
        to respond to a recall or a client's lease is expired due to\
        non-renewal.  It might also revoke the layout as a means of\
        enforcing a change in locking state or access permissions that\
        the storage device cannot directly enforce.\
\
        Effective revocation may require client cooperation in using a\
        particular stateid (file layout) or principal (e.g., flexible\
        file layout) when performing I/O.\
\
        In contrast, there is no requirement to restrict access to a\
        file on the storage devices when a layout is recalled.  It is\
        only after the metadata server determines that the client is not\
        gracefully returning the layout and starts the revocation that\
        this requirement is enforced.\
\
   (3)  A pNFS implementation MUST NOT allow the violation of NFSv4.1's\
        access controls: Access Control Lists (ACLs) and file open\
        modes.  Section 12.9 of [RFC5661] specifically lays this burden\
        on the combination of clients, storage devices, and the metadata\
        server.  However, the specification of the individual layout\
        type might create requirements as to how this is to be done.\
        This may include a possible requirement for the metadata server\
        to update the storage device so that it can enforce security.\
\
        The file layout requires the storage device to enforce access\
        whereas the flexible file layout requires both the storage\
        device and the client to enforce security.\

\
\
   (4)  Interactions between locking and I/O operations MUST obey\
        existing semantic restrictions.  In particular, if an I/O\
        operation would be invalid when directed at the metadata server,\
        it is not to be allowed when performed on the storage device.\
\
        For the block and SCSI layouts, as the storage device is not\
        able to reject the I/O operation, the client is responsible for\
        enforcing this requirement.\
\
   (5)  Any disagreement between the metadata server and the data server\
        as to the value of attributes such as modify time, the change\
        attribute, and the EOF position MUST be of limited duration with\
        clear means of resolution of any discrepancies being provided.\
        Note the following:\
\
        (a)  Discrepancies need not be resolved unless any client has\
             accessed the file in question via the metadata server,\
             typically by performing a GETATTR.\
\
        (b)  A particular storage device might be striped, and as such,\
             its local view of the EOF position does not match the\
             global EOF position.\
\
        (c)  Both clock skew and network delay can lead to the metadata\
             server and the storage device having different values of\
             the time attributes.  As long as those differences can be\
             accounted for in what is presented to the client in a\
             GETATTR, then no violation results.\
\
        (d)  A LAYOUTCOMMIT requires that changes in attributes\
             resulting from operations on the storage device need to be\
             reflected in the metadata server by the completion of the\
             operation.\
\
   These requirements may be satisfied in different ways by different\
   layout types.  As an example, while the file layout type uses the\
   stateid to fence off the client, there is no requirement that other\
   layout types use this stateid approach.\
\
   Each new Standards Track document for a layout type MUST address how\
   the client, metadata server, and storage devices are to interact to\
   meet these requirements.\
\
3.2.  Previously Undocumented Protocol Requirements\
\
   While not explicitly stated as requirements in Section 12 of\
   [RFC5661], the existing layout types do have more requirements that\
   they need to enforce.\

RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   The client has these obligations when making I/O requests to the\
   storage devices:\
\
   (1)  Clients MUST NOT perform I/O to the storage device if they do\
        not have layouts for the files in question.\
\
   (2)  Clients MUST NOT perform I/O operations outside of the specified\
        ranges in the layout segment.\
\
   (3)  Clients MUST NOT perform I/O operations that would be\
        inconsistent with the iomode specified in the layout segments it\
        holds.\
\
   Under the file layout type, the storage devices are able to reject\
   any request made not conforming to these requirements.  This may not\
   be possible for other known layout types, which puts the burden of\
   enforcing such violations solely on the client.  For these layout\
   types:\
\
   (1)  The metadata server MAY use fencing operations to the storage\
        devices to enforce layout revocation against the client.\
\
   (2)  The metadata server MUST allow the clients to perform data I/O\
        against it, even if it has already granted the client a layout.\
        A layout type might discourage such I/O, but it cannot forbid\
        it.\
\
   (3)  The metadata server MUST be able to do storage allocation,\
        whether that is to create, delete, extend, or truncate files.\
\
   The means to address these requirements will vary with the layout\
   type.  A control protocol will be used to effect these; the control\
   protocol could be a purpose-built one, one identical to the storage\
   protocol, or a new Standards Track control protocol.\
\
3.3.  Editorial Requirements\
\
   This section discusses how the protocol requirements discussed above\
   need to be addressed in documents specifying a new layout type.\
   Depending on the interoperability model for the layout type in\
   question, this may involve the imposition of layout-type-specific\
   requirements that ensure appropriate interoperability of pNFS\
   components that are developed separately.\
\
   The specification of the layout type needs to make clear how the\
   client, metadata server, and storage device act together to meet the\
   protocol requirements discussed previously.  If the document does not\

RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   impose implementation requirements sufficient to ensure that these\
   semantic requirements are met, it is not appropriate for publication\
   as an RFC from the IETF stream.\
\
   Some examples include:\
\
   o  If the metadata server does not have a means to invalidate a\
      stateid issued to the storage device to keep a particular client\
      from accessing a specific file, then the layout type specification\
      has to document how the metadata server is going to fence the\
      client from access to the file on that storage device.\
\
   o  If the metadata server implements mandatory byte-range locking\
      when accessed directly by the client, then the layout type\
      specification must require that this also be done when data is\
      read or written using the designated storage protocol.\
\
4.  Specifications of Original Layout Types\
\
   This section discusses how the original layout types interact with\
   Section 12 of [RFC5661], which enumerates the requirements of pNFS\
   layout type specifications.  It is not normative with regards to the\
   file layout type presented in Section 13 of [RFC5661], the block\
   layout type [RFC5663], and the object layout type [RFC5664].  These\
   are discussed here only to illuminate the updates Section 3 of this\
   document makes to Section 12 of [RFC5661].\
\
4.1.  File Layout Type\
\
   Because the storage protocol is a subset of NFSv4.1, the semantics of\
   the file layout type comes closest to the semantics of NFSv4.1 in the\
   absence of pNFS.  In particular, the stateid and principal used for\
   I/O MUST have the same effect and be subject to the same validation\
   on a data server as it would have if the I/O were being performed on\
   the metadata server itself.  The same set of validations are applied\
   whether or not pNFS is in effect.\
\
   While for most implementations, the storage devices can do the\
   following validations that are each presented as a "SHOULD" and not a\
   "MUST" in [RFC5661]:\
\
   (1)  client holds a valid layout,\
\
   (2)  client I/O matches the layout iomode, and\
\
   (3)  client does not go out of the byte ranges,\
\
\
\
\
\
Haynes                       Standards Track                   [Page 11]\
\
RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   Actually, the first point is presented in [RFC5661] as both:\
\
   "MUST":  in Section 13.6\
\
      As described in Section 12.5.1, a client MUST NOT send an I/O to a\
      data server for which it does not hold a valid layout; the data\
      server MUST reject such an I/O.\
\
   "SHOULD":  in Section 13.8\
\
      The iomode need not be checked by the data servers when clients\
      perform I/O.  However, the data servers SHOULD still validate that\
      the client holds a valid layout and return an error if the client\
      does not.\
\
   It should be noted that it is just these layout-specific checks that\
   are optional, not the normal file access semantics.  The storage\
   devices MUST make all of the required access checks on each READ or\
   WRITE I/O as determined by the NFSv4.1 protocol.  If the metadata\
   server would deny a READ or WRITE operation on a file due to its ACL,\
   mode attribute, open access mode, open deny mode, mandatory byte-\
   range locking state, or any other attributes and state, the storage\
   device MUST also deny the READ or WRITE operation.  Also, while the\
   NFSv4.1 protocol does not mandate export access checks based on the\
   client's IP address, if the metadata server implements such a policy,\
   then that counts as such state as outlined above.\
\
   The data filehandle provided by the PUTFH operation to the data\
   server provides sufficient context to enable the data server to\
   ensure that the client has a valid layout for the I/O being performed\
   for the subsequent READ or WRITE operation in the compound.\
\
   Finally, the data server can check the stateid presented in the READ\
   or WRITE operation to see if that stateid has been rejected by the\
   metadata server; if so, the data server will cause the I/O to be\
   fenced.  Whilst it might just be the open owner or lock owner on that\
   client being fenced, the client should take the NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID\
   error code to mean it has been fenced from the file and contact the\
   metadata server.\
\
4.2.  Block Layout Type\
\
   With the block layout type, the storage devices are generally not\
   able to enforce file-based security.  Typically, storage area network\
   (SAN) disk arrays and SAN protocols provide coarse-grained access\
   control mechanisms (e.g., Logical Unit Number (LUN) mapping and/or\
   masking), with a target granularity of disks rather than individual\
   blocks and a source granularity of individual hosts rather than of\
\

RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   users or owners.  Access to block storage is logically at a lower\
   layer of the I/O stack than NFSv4.  Since NFSv4 security is not\
   directly applicable to protocols that access such storage directly,\
   Section 2.1 of [RFC5663] specifies that:\
\
      in environments where pNFS clients cannot be trusted to enforce\
      such policies, pNFS block layout types SHOULD NOT be used.\
\
   Due to these granularity issues, the security burden has been shifted\
   from the storage devices to the client.  Those deploying\
   implementations of this layout type need to be sure that the client\
   implementation can be trusted.  This is not a new sort of requirement\
   in the context of SAN protocols.  In such environments, the client is\
   expected to provide block-based protection.\
\
   This shift of the burden also extends to locks and layouts.  The\
   storage devices are not able to enforce any of these, and the burden\
   is pushed to the client to make the appropriate checks before sending\
   I/O to the storage devices.  For example, the server may use a layout\
   iomode only allowing reading to enforce a mandatory read-only lock.\
   In such cases, the client has to support that use by not sending\
   WRITEs to the storage devices.  The fundamental issue here is that\
   the storage device is treated by this layout type in the same fashion\
   as a local disk device.  Once the client has access to the storage\
   device, it is able to perform both READ and WRITE I/O to the entire\
   storage device.  The byte ranges in the layout, any locks, the layout\
   iomode, etc., can only be enforced by the client.  Therefore, the\
   client is required to provide that enforcement.\
\
   In the context of fencing off of the client upon revocation of a\
   layout, these limitations come into play again, i.e., the granularity\
   of the fencing can only be at the level of the host and logical unit.\
   Thus, if one of a client's layouts is revoked by the server, it will\
   effectively revoke all of the client's layouts for files located on\
   the storage units comprising the logical volume.  This may extend to\
   the client's layouts for files in other file systems.  Clients need\
   to be prepared for such revocations and reacquire layouts as needed.\
\
4.3.  Object Layout Type\
\
   With the object layout type, security checks occur during the\
   allocation of the layout.  The client will typically ask for layouts\
   covering all of the file and may do so for either READ or READ/WRITE.\
   This enables it to do subsequent I/O operations without the need to\
   obtain layouts for specific byte ranges.  At that time, the metadata\
   server should verify permissions against the layout iomode, the file\
   mode bits or ACLs, etc.  As the client may be acting for multiple\

\
\
   local users, it MUST authenticate and authorize the user by issuing\
   respective OPEN and ACCESS calls to the metadata server, similar to\
   having NFSv4 data delegations.\
\
   Upon successful authorization, the client receives within the layout\
   a set of object capabilities allowing it I/O access to the specified\
   objects corresponding to the requested iomode.  These capabilities\
   are used to enforce access control and locking semantics at the\
   storage devices.  Whenever one of the following occurs on the\
   metadata server, then the metadata server MUST change the capability\
   version attribute on all objects comprising the file in order to\
   invalidate any outstanding capabilities before committing to one of\
   these changes:\
\
   o  the permissions on the object change,\
\
   o  a conflicting mandatory byte-range lock is granted, or\
\
   o  a layout is revoked and reassigned to another client.\
\
   When the metadata server wishes to fence off a client to a particular\
   object, then it can use the above approach to invalidate the\
   capability attribute on the given object.  The client can be informed\
   via the storage device that the capability has been rejected and is\
   allowed to fetch a refreshed set of capabilities, i.e., reacquire the\
   layout.\
\
5.  Summary\
\
   In the three original layout types, the burden of enforcing the\
   security of NFSv4.1 can fall to either the storage devices (files),\
   the client (blocks), or the metadata server (objects).  Such choices\
   are conditioned by the native capabilities of the storage devices --\
   if a control protocol can be implemented, then the burden can be\
   shifted primarily to the storage devices.\
\
   In the context of this document, we treat the control protocol as a\
   set of requirements.  As new layout types are published, the defining\
   documents MUST address:\
\
   (1)  The fencing of clients after a layout is revoked.\
\
   (2)  The security implications of the native capabilities of the\
        storage devices with respect to the requirements of the NFSv4.1\
        security model.\

RFC 8434                    pNFS Layout Types                August 2018\
\
\
   In addition, these defining documents need to make clear how other\
   semantic requirements of NFSv4.1 (e.g., locking) are met in the\
   context of the proposed layout type.\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   This section does not deal directly with security considerations for\
   existing or new layout types.  Instead, it provides a general\
   framework for understating security-related issues within the pNFS\
   framework.  Specific security considerations will be addressed in the\
   Security Considerations sections of documents specifying layout\
   types.  For example, in Section 3 of [RFC5663], the lack of finer-\
   than-physical disk access control necessitates that the client is\
   delegated the responsibility to enforce the access provided to them\
   in the layout extent that they were granted by the metadata server.\
\
   The layout type specification must ensure that only data access\
   consistent with the NFSV4.1 security model is allowed.  It may do\
   this directly, by providing that appropriate checks be performed at\
   the time each access is performed.  It may do it indirectly by\
   allowing the client or the storage device to be responsible for\
   making the appropriate checks.  In the latter case, I/O access rights\
   are reflected in layouts, and the layout type must provide a way to\
   prevent inappropriate access due to permissions changes between the\
   time a layout is granted and the time the access is performed.\
\
   The metadata server MUST be able to fence off a client's access to\
   the data file on a storage device.  When it revokes the layout, the\
   client's access MUST be terminated at the storage devices.  The\
   client has a subsequent opportunity to reacquire the layout and\
   perform the security check in the context of the newly current access\
   permissions.\
\
7.  IANA Considerations\

1.  Introduction\
\
   Modern IMAP [RFC3501] server deployments often have peer systems with\
   administrative privilege that perform actions on behalf of IMAP end\
   users.  For example, a voicemail gateway can use IMAP to store a\
   user's voicemail and mark that voicemail as \\Seen when the user\
   listens to it via the phone interface.  These systems can issue the\
   IMAP AUTHENTICATE command with administrative credentials to act on\
   behalf of other users.  However, with the IMAP base specification,\
   these specialized IMAP clients must close the connection and create a\
   new connection for each user.  For efficiency reasons, it is\
   desirable for these clients to reuse the same connection,\
   particularly if SSL has been negotiated.  This specification proposes\
   the UNAUTHENTICATE command to achieve this goal.\
\
   The IMAP state machine described in Section 3 of RFC 3501 does not\
   have a transition from authenticated or selected state to not\
   authenticated state.  The UNAUTHENTICATE command adds this\
   transition.\
\

RFC 8437        IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse     August 2018\
\
\
3.  UNAUTHENTICATE Command\
\
   Arguments:  None\
\
   Responses:  No specific response for this command\
\
   Result:     OK - Completed, now in not authenticated state\
               BAD - Command unknown or arguments invalid\
\
   This command directs the server to reset all connection state except\
   for the state of the TLS [RFC8446] layer.  Upon completion, the\
   server connection is placed in not authenticated state.  This\
   represents Transition 7 in the State Machine Diagram (Section 5).\
\
   If a mailbox was selected, the mailbox ceases to be selected, but no\
   expunge event is generated.  If a Simple Authentication and Security\
   Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] was active, the server terminates its outgoing\
   security layer immediately after sending the CRLF following the OK\
   response.  The client's outgoing security layer terminates\
   immediately after the CRLF following the UNAUTHENTICATE command.\
   Note that a BAD response only occurs if UNAUTHENTICATE is issued in\
   an invalid state, is not advertised by the server, or does not follow\
   the command syntax in the specification.  A NO response is not\
   permitted.  As a result, specification-compliant implementations will\
   interoperate across security layer termination.\
\
   After sending this command, the client is free to issue a new\
   AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command as permitted based on the server's\
   capabilities.  If no SASL security layer was active, the client is\
   permitted to pipeline the UNAUTHENTICATE command with a subsequent\
   AUTHENTICATE command.  If the IMAP server also advertises SASL-IR\
   [RFC4959], this permits an administrative client to re-authenticate\
   in one round trip.  Because of this pipelining optimization, a server\
   advertising UNAUTHENTICATE is not permitted to respond to the\
   UNAUTHENTICATE command with a NO response if it is unable to reset\
   the state associated with the connection.  Servers MAY close the\
   connection with an untagged BYE response if this preferably rare\
   situation occurs.\
\
   Servers MAY choose to advertise the UNAUTHENTICATE capability only\
   after authentication has completed.  As a result, clients may need to\
   issue an IMAP CAPABILITY command after authentication in order to\
   determine the availability of UNAUTHENTICATE.\

RFC 8437        IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse     August 2018\
\
\
   The IMAP ID [RFC2971] command provides properties about the client\
   primarily for use in server log or audit files.  Because IMAP ID is\
   not related to application authentication or user identity in any\
   way, and caching it for the duration of the client connection can be\
   useful, the interaction between IMAP ID and the UNAUTHENTICATE\
   command is defined by the implementation.\
\
4.  Interactions\
\
   This section describes interactions between this extension and other\
   IMAP extensions or usage models.\
\
4.1.  Stateful Extensions\
\
   The connection state for the following list of IMAP extensions MUST\
   be reset if both a) the specified extension is advertised and b) the\
   UNAUTHENTICATE command is advertised and used.  This list may not be\
   complete; the requirement to reset the connection state applies to\
   all current and future extensions except STARTTLS and ID.  Additional\
   requirements apply to specific stateful extensions as follows:\
\
   o  Cached identity information, such as group memberships, that are\
      used to evaluate access control lists [RFC4314] MUST be reset.\
\
   o  After an UNAUTHENTICATE command is issued, CONDSTORE servers\
      [RFC7162] MUST behave as if no CONDSTORE-enabling command was\
      issued.\
\
   o  If IMAP COMPRESS [RFC4978] is active, the server terminates its\
      outgoing compression layer after it sends the CRLF following the\
      OK response.  The client terminates its outgoing compression layer\
      after the CRLF following the UNAUTHENTICATE command.  When it\
      matters, the compression layer terminates before a SASL layer\
      terminates.\
\
   o  Any extensions enabled by the IMAP ENABLE [RFC5161] command cease\
      to be enabled when the UNAUTHENTICATE command is issued.  This\
      includes, but is not limited to, CONDSTORE [RFC7162], QRESYNC\
      [RFC7162], METADATA [RFC5464], METADATA-SERVER [RFC5464], and\
      UTF8=ACCEPT [RFC6855].\
\
   o  A server advertising SEARCHRES [RFC5182] discards any saved search\
      results so that '$' subsequently represents the empty set.\
\
   o  A server advertising LANGUAGE [RFC5255] will revert to the\
      "i-default" language.\

RFC 8437        IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse     August 2018\
\
\
   o  When a server advertises CONTEXT=SEARCH or CONTEXT=SORT [RFC5267],\
      the UNAUTHENTICATE command includes an implicit CANCELUPDATE for\
      all server contexts.\
\
   o  When a server advertises NOTIFY [RFC5465], the UNAUTHENTICATE\
      command cancels the server state related to the NOTIFY command and\
      reverts to default IMAP base-specification behavior for\
      notifications.\
\
4.2.  Client Certificates, SASL EXTERNAL, and imaps\
\
   When a TLS [RFC8446] security layer is negotiated using either the\
   STARTTLS command or the imaps port [RFC8314], IMAP servers may be\
   configured to request a client certificate, and IMAP clients may\
   provide one.  Client credentials at the TLS layer do not normally\
   impact the application layer; however, they do have an impact when\
   the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism [RFC4422] in an IMAP AUTHENTICATE command\
   is used to direct the server to use the provided client certificate\
   to authenticate as the specified IMAP user.  The UNAUTHENTICATE\
   command breaks any application-level binding of the TLS client\
   credentials but does not discard the client credentials.  As a\
   result, an administrative client may use a client certificate with\
   administrative privilege to act on behalf of multiple IMAP users in\
   the same connection via the EXTERNAL mechanism and the UNAUTHENTICATE\
   command.\
\
   Some server implementations using the imaps port will request and use\
   a TLS client certificate to authenticate immediately as the default\
   IMAP identity associated with that certificate.  These\
   implementations indicate this behavior by using the PREAUTH greeting,\
   as indicated by Transition 2 in the State Machine Diagram\
   (Section 5).  As a result, TLS client certificates cannot be used for\
   administrative proxy authentication with the imaps port unless the\
   UNAUTHENTICATE command is also advertised.  In that case, an\
   administrative client can respond to the PREAUTH greeting with an\
   UNAUTHENTICATE command and then issue an AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL\
   command.\

   [RFC3501].\
\

\
     command-auth   =/ "UNAUTHENTICATE"\
\
     command-select =/ "UNAUTHENTICATE"\
\
7.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has added the UNAUTHENTICATE capability to the "IMAP\
   Capabilities" registry.\
\
8.  Security Considerations\
\
   The original IMAP state machine was designed to allow a server-\
   implementation approach in which each IMAP authentication identity\
   matches an operating system identity and the server revokes all\
   administrative privilege once authentication completes.  This\
   extension is not compatible with that implementation approach.\
   However, that approach has significant performance costs on Unix\
   systems, and this extension is designed for environments where\
   efficiency is a relatively high-priority deployment goal.  This\
   extension is therefore appropriate for some deployments but may not\
   be appropriate for the most security-sensitive environments.\
\
   IMAP server implementations are complicated and can retain a lot of\
   state related to an authenticated user.  Server implementers need to\
   take care to reset all server state such that authentication as a\
   subsequent user does not inherit any data or privileges from the\
   previous user.  State data associated with a user can include cached\
   identity information such as group membership used to evaluate access\
   control lists [RFC4314], active notifications [RFC5465], access to\
   per-user data such as flags, etc.\

RFC 8437        IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse     August 2018\
\
\
   IMAP server systems are often deployed in a two-tier model where a\
   server-side IMAP proxy routes to an IMAP backend that handles all\
   connections for a subset of possible users.  Some IMAP proxies enter\
   a pass-through mode after authentication.  If enabled, the\
   UNAUTHENTICATE command would allow a client, on a subsequent\
   authentication, to bypass any security restrictions present in the\
   proxy layer but not in the backend server layer.  As a result, IMAP\
   server implementations of this extension MUST provide a way to\
   disable it when it is not needed.  Use of an IMAP proxy that\
   processes the UNAUTHENTICATE command at the proxy layer eliminates\
   this concern.  Another option to mitigate this concern is for servers\
   to only enable the UNAUTHENTICATE extension if the supplied\
   authentication credentials are associated with an administrative\
   identity.\
\
9.  Privacy Considerations\
\
   For the most part, this extension will have no impact on the privacy\
   considerations already present in an IMAP implementation.  However,\
   if this extension were used between data centers, it could improve\
   end-user privacy by increasing the difficultly of traffic analysis\
   due to connection reuse.\

RFC 8437        IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse     August 2018\
\
\
Appendix A.  Design Considerations\
\
   The author deliberately chose to add a separate UNAUTHENTICATE\
   command instead of allowing the LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE commands to be\
   issued when the connection is in a state other than unauthenticated.\
   The primary reason for this choice is that the code that transitions\
   from not authenticated state to authenticated state in a server is\
   often the most security-sensitive code, because it needs to assume\
   and handle unconditionally hostile attackers.  That sensitive code is\
   simpler if it only handles a single server state (unauthenticated)\
   and the state transition is as simple as possible.  Smaller and\
   simpler code is easier to audit and write in a secure way.\
\
   A secondary reason to have a separate command is that it is simpler\
   to enable or disable the feature with that design.  See the\
   discussion in the Security Considerations section recommending that\
   implementations provide a way to disable this extension.\

    Update to IANA Registration Procedures for Pool 3 Values in the\
        Differentiated Services Field Codepoints (DSCP) Registry\
\
Abstract\
\
   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of\
   the DS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one of 64\
   distinct differentiated services field codepoint (DSCP) values.  The\
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of\
   assigned DSCP values.\
\
   This update to RFC 2474 changes the IANA registration policy for Pool\
   3 of the registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards\
   Action, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best\
   Current Practice RFC.  The update also removes permission for\
   experimental and local use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the\
   DSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form\
   xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.\

\
1.  Introduction\
\
   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) [RFC2475] architecture\
   (updated by [RFC3260]) provides scalable service differentiation in\
   the Internet.  Diffserv uses the six most significant bits of the\
   former IPv4 Type of Service (TOS) octet or the former IPv6 Traffic\
   Class octet to convey the field, which is used to carry the DSCP.\
   This DSCP value is used to select a Diffserv per-hop behavior (PHB).\
\
   The six-bit field is capable of conveying 64 distinct codepoints, and\
   this codepoint space has been divided into three pools for the\
   purpose of codepoint assignment and management (as shown in\
   Figure 1).  Pool 1 comprises 32 codepoints [RFC2474].  These are\
   assigned by Standards Action, as defined in [RFC8126].  Pool 2\
   comprises a pool of 16 codepoints reserved for Experimental or Local\
   Use (EXP/LU) as defined in [RFC2474].  Pool 3 comprises 16\
   codepoints, which were originally specified as "initially available\
   for experimental or local use, but which should be preferentially\
   utilized for standardized assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted" by\
   [RFC2474].\

\
    Figure 1: Format of the Field for Codepoints Allocated in the Three\
            IANA Pools (Where "x" Refers to Either "0" or "1")\
\
   At the time of writing this document, 22 of the 32 Pool 1 codepoints\
   have been assigned.\
\
   Although Pool 1 has not yet been completely exhausted, there is a\
   need to assign codepoints for particular PHBs that are unable to use\
   any of the unassigned values in Pool 1.  This document changes the\
   IANA registration policy of Pool 3 to assignment by Standards Action.\
   (Section 4.9 of [RFC8126] defines this as "assigned only through\
   Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFCs in the IETF Stream".)\
\
   An example is the need to assign a suitable recommended default\
   codepoint for the Lower Effort (LE) PHB [LE-PHB].  The LE PHB is\
   designed to protect best-effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with\
   the default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations (when\
   resources become scarce, best-effort traffic has precedence over LE\
   traffic and is allowed to preempt it).  In deployed networks,\
   bleaching (i.e. intentionally setting to zero) of the IP Precedence\
   field continues to be used.  (Setting the IP Precedence field to zero\
   disables any class-based flow management by routers configured with\
   TOS-based packet processing.)  This causes the first three bits of\
   the former TOS byte (now the upper part of the DSCP field) to become\
   zero.  Therefore, there is a need to avoid this remapping of the DSCP\
   for the LE PHB by assigning a codepoint that already has a zero value\
   in the first three bits [LE-PHB].\
\
   Furthermore, if the LE PHB were to have been assigned one of the\
   currently unused Pool 1 codepoints with a zero value in the first\
   three bits, any bleaching of the IP Precedence field would result in\
   other (higher assurance) traffic being also remapped to the assigned\
   DSCP.  This remapping could then cause Diffserv-marked traffic to\
   receive an unintentional LE treatment for the remainder of the\
   Internet path.  Therefore, it is important to avoid the resulting\
   priority inversion.  The absence of unassigned codepoints in Pool 1\
   that exhibit these important properties motivates assigning a Pool 3\
   codepoint as the default that is recommended for use with this PHB.\

RFC 8436      IANA Registration Procedures for DSCP Pool 3   August 2018\
\
\
   To allow the IETF to utilize Pool 3 codepoints, this document\
   requests IANA to manage Pool 3 assignments for DSCP values in Pool 3\
   via the Standards Action policy [RFC8126].\
\
2.  Terminology\
\
   This document assumes familiarity with the terminology used in\
   [RFC2475] updated by [RFC3260].\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
3.  The Updates to RFC 2474\
\
   This document updates Section 6 of [RFC2474] in the following ways.\
\
   It updates the following text concerning the assignment policy:\
\
   OLD:  which are initially available for experimental or local use,\
      but which should be preferentially utilized for standardized\
      assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted.\
\
   NEW:  which are utilized for standardized assignments (replacing the\
      previous availability for experimental or local use).\
\
   It removes the footnote in RFC 2474 relating to Pool 3:\
\
   DELETE:  "(*) may be utilized for future Standards Action allocations\
      as necessary"\
\
   The new registry assignment policy is shown in Figure 2.\
\

RFC 8436      IANA Registration Procedures for DSCP Pool 3   August 2018\
\
\
4.  Security Considerations\
\
   Security considerations for the use of DSCP values are described in\
   the RFCs that define their usage.  This document does not present new\
   security considerations.\
\
5.  IANA Considerations\
\
   IANA has changed the use of Pool 3 in the "Differentiated Services\
   Field Codepoints (DSCP)" registry and will manage this pool using\
   Standards Action, as defined as Section 4.9 of [RFC8126].\
\
   IANA has made the following changes to the "Differentiated Services\
   Field Codepoints (DSCP)" registry, made available at [Registry].\
\
   IANA has referenced RFC 2474 and Section 4 of RFC 3260 for the\
   overall format of this registry.\
\
   IANA has referenced RFC 2474 and Section 4 of RFC 3260 for Pool 1.\
\
   This document does not modify the IANA registry text for Pool 2.\
   This pool continues to preserve the note shown in Figure 2.\
\
   The previous registry text for Pool 3:\
\
      3 xxxx01 Experimental or local use may be utilized for future\
      Standards Action allocations as necessary.\
\
   is replaced with the following registry text:\
\
      3 xxxx01 Standards Action.\
\
   To manage codepoints in Pool 3, IANA has created and will maintain\
   the "DSCP Pool 3 Codepoints" subregistry.  Pool 3 of the registry has\
   been created initially empty, with a format identical to that used\
   for "DSCP Pool 1 Codepoints".\
\
   IANA has referenced RFC 2474, Section 4 of RFC 3260, and the current\
   document for Pool 3.\
\
   The registration procedure for use of Pool 3 is Standards Action, as\
   defined as Section 4.9 of [RFC8126].  IANA is expected to normally\
   make assignments from Pool 1, until this Pool is exhausted, but it\
   MAY make assignments from Pool 3 when the format of the codepoint has\
   properties that are needed for a specific PHB.  The required\
   characteristics for choosing a requested DSCP value MUST be explained\
   in the IANA Considerations section of the document that requests any\
   assignment from Pool 3.\

1.  Introduction\
\
   IMAP [RFC3501] clients typically fetch the set of rights granted on\
   mailboxes so they can expose the allowed functionality to the logged-\
   in user.  In order to do that, the client is forced to issue a LIST\
   or LSUB command to list all available mailboxes, followed by a\
   MYRIGHTS command for each mailbox found.  This document defines an\
   extension to the to IMAP LIST command that is identified by the\
   capability string "LIST-MYRIGHTS".  The LIST-MYRIGHTS extension\
   allows the client to request the set of rights that the logged-in\
   user has been granted on mailboxes, along with other information\
   typically returned by the LIST command.\
\
2.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected\
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
3.  MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command\
\
   [RFC4314] defines the MYRIGHTS command, which is used by an IMAP\
   client to determine the set of rights that the logged-in user has\
   been granted on a given mailbox.  Frequently, a client will have to\
   look up the rights for some or all of the mailboxes returned by the\

RFC 8440                   IMAP LIST-MYRIGHTS                August 2018\
\
\
   LIST command.  Doing so in multiple MYRIGHTS commands wastes\
   bandwidth and can degrade performance if the client does not pipeline\
   the requests.\
\
   This document extends the LIST command with a new "MYRIGHTS" return\
   option [RFC5258] that allows the client to request all of the desired\
   information in a single command.  For each listable mailbox matching\
   the list pattern and selection options, the server MUST return an\
   untagged LIST response and SHOULD also return an untagged MYRIGHTS\
   response containing the set of rights granted to the logged-in user.\
   The ordering of the responses is significant only in that the server\
   MUST NOT send a MYRIGHTS response for a given mailbox before it sends\
   the LIST response for that mailbox.\
\
   If the server is unable to look up the set of rights for a given\
   mailbox, it does not send the MYRIGHTS reply for that mailbox.\
\
   Client authors ought to note that generating the MYRIGHTS responses\
   for a large number of mailboxes may be an expensive operation for the\
   server.  Clients SHOULD use a suitable match pattern and/or selection\
   option to limit the set of mailboxes returned to only those in whose\
   rights they are interested.\
\
4.  Examples\
\
   In this example, the "bar" mailbox doesn't exist, so it has no\
   MYRIGHTS reply.\
\
   C: A01 LIST "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)\
   S: * LIST () "." "INBOX"\
   S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda\
   S: * LIST () "." "foo"\
   S: * MYRIGHTS "foo" lrs\
   S: * LIST (\\NonExistent) "." "bar"\
   S: A01 OK List completed.\
\
   In this example, the LIST reply for the "foo" mailbox is returned\
   because it has matching children, but no MYRIGHTS reply is returned,\
   because "foo" itself doesn't match the selection criteria.\
\
   C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED RECURSIVEMATCH) "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)\
   S: * LIST (\\Subscribed) "." "INBOX"\
   S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda\
   S: * LIST () "." "foo" (CHILDINFO ("SUBSCRIBED"))\
   S: A02 OK List completed.\

\
5.  Formal Syntax\
\
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur\
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].  Terms not defined here are\
   taken from [RFC5258].\
\
   return-option =/ "MYRIGHTS"\
\
6.  Security Considerations\
\
   In addition to the security considerations described in [RFC4314],\
   this extension makes it a bit easier for clients to overload the\
   server by requesting MYRIGHTS information for a large number of\
   mailboxes.  However, as noted in the introduction, existing clients\
   already try to do that by generating a large number of MYRIGHTS\
   commands for each mailbox in which they are interested.  While\
   performing MYRIGHTS information retrieval for big lists of mailboxes,\
   a server implementation needs to make sure that it can still serve\
   other IMAP connections and yield execution to other connections, when\
   necessary.\
\
7.  Privacy Considerations\
\
   This specification does not introduce any additional privacy concerns\
   beyond those described in [RFC4314].\
\
8.  IANA Considerations\
\
8.1.  Registration of IMAP Capability LIST-MYRIGHTS\

1.  Introduction\
\
   This document extends the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)\
   [IMAP4rev1] with a new capability called "STATUS=SIZE".  To determine\
   the total storage size of a mailbox, an IMAP client currently needs\
   to retrieve all message sizes individually using the FETCH command\
   with the RFC822.SIZE data item.  The STATUS=SIZE capability provides\
   a more efficient means of achieving this.  It extends the STATUS\
   command with a new "SIZE" data item, which indicates the total size\
   of all messages in the target mailbox.  This way, this information\
   can be queried with just one STATUS command.  When the LIST-STATUS\
   IMAP capability [LIST-STATUS] is also available, the SIZE data item\
   can be queried for many mailboxes at once using just one LIST\
   command.\
\
   This capability is particularly useful for IMAP clients that do not\
   cache the state of the message store, such as most webmail clients.\
   Without the "STATUS=SIZE" capability, such clients need to fetch all\
   message sizes from the server when the size of an individual mailbox\
   needs to be determined.  For example, a user may request detailed\
   quota usage information for each mailbox to find out which specific\
   mailboxes consume most of the available storage resources.  Using\
   this information, the user can get an overview of which mailboxes\
   need to be cleaned up to reduce quota usage.  The QUOTA capability\
   [QUOTA] is no help in that scenario, since the provided QUOTAROOT\
   command can only yield the STORAGE resource usage of a whole quota\
   root, not each individual mailbox within that root.\

\
\
2.  Conventions Used in This Document\
\
   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected\
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.\
\
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",\
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and\
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
   BCP 14 [KEYWORDS] [KEYWORDS2] when, and only when, they appear in all\
   capitals, as shown here.\
\
3.  STATUS Command and Response Extensions\
\
   This extension defines one new status data item for the STATUS\
   command and response:\
\
   SIZE\
      The total size of the mailbox in octets.  This is not strictly\
      required to be an exact value, but it MUST be equal to or greater\
      than the sum of the values of the RFC822.SIZE FETCH message data\
      item [IMAP4rev1] of all messages in the mailbox.  When the QUOTA\
      capability [QUOTA] is also supported, this value SHOULD be equal\
      to the storage usage value used to enforce the STORAGE resource\
      limit for this mailbox.  This way, the client can directly infer\
      the quota usage.\
\
   Since the total storage size of a mailbox can easily exceed 4 GB,\
   clients MUST be capable of receiving 63-bit SIZE data item values.\
   The message size is chosen to be at most 63 bits wide rather than 64\
   bits to make implementations on various platforms (such as Java)\
   easier.\
\
   Example:\
\
   C: A01 STATUS frop (MESSAGES SIZE UIDNEXT)\
   S: * STATUS frop (MESSAGES 8 SIZE 44421 UIDNEXT 242344)\
   S: A01 OK STATUS completed\
\
\
\
\
\
\

\
RFC 8438               IMAP STATUS=SIZE Extension            August 2018\
\
\
   The same information can be obtained by using the following commands,\
   albeit less efficiently:\
\
   C: A02 SELECT "frop"\
   S: * FLAGS (\\Answered \\Flagged \\Deleted \\Seen \\Draft)\
   S: * 8 EXISTS\
   S: * 1 RECENT\
   S: * OK [UNSEEN 7] First unseen.\
   S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 1364851417] UIDs valid\
   S: * OK [UIDNEXT 242344] Predicted next UID\
   S: * OK [HIGHESTMODSEQ 3914] Highest\
   S: A02 OK [READ-WRITE] Select completed.\
   C: A03 FETCH 1:* (RFC822.SIZE)\
   S: * 1 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 3224)\
   S: * 2 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 1222)\
   S: * 3 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 444)\
   S: * 4 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 4516)\
   S: * 5 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 544)\
   S: * 6 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 922)\
   S: * 7 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 31126)\
   S: * 8 FETCH (RFC822.SIZE 2423)\
   S: A03 OK Fetch completed.\
\
   When the LIST-STATUS IMAP capability [LIST-STATUS] is also available,\
   the STATUS command can be combined with the LIST command to further\
   improve efficiency.  This way, the sizes of many mailboxes can be\
   queried with just one LIST command.\
\
   Example:\
\
   C: A04 LIST "" % RETURN (STATUS (MESSAGES SIZE))\
   S: * LIST () "." "INBOX"\
   S: * STATUS "INBOX" (MESSAGES 17 SIZE 16234)\
   S: * LIST () "." "frop"\
   S: * STATUS "frop" (MESSAGES 8 SIZE 44421)\
   S: A04 OK List completed.\

\
5.  Security Considerations\
\
   There are no known additional security issues with this extension\
   beyond those described for the base protocol [IMAP4rev1] and the\
   LIST-STATUS extension [LIST-STATUS].\
